1kts9gm,"First 11kg Haul to Germany (Carharrt, Asics, Birkenstocks, Stussy, AMI, Ralph, Nike..)","Hello,  
my first purchase on CNFans.  
Stats: 184cm, 90kg (been going to gym for almost 2 years); every item is L   
Shipping to germany was about 16 days, 11Kg and 160 Euros shipping cost.  
I chose to vacuum my items, thats why they are so wrinkled.

Short Review:  
AMI Shirt (9/10):  
Would size up, Quality is nice and the colour is in reallife better than on pictures

RL Shirts (grey and blue) (10/10):  
Quality is great, def. recommend and tts  


RL Jacket (8/10):  
Quality is good, feels authentic, a bit small, would size up 

Nike Hoodies (10/10):  
very good hoodies for that price, gift for friends so cannot say about sizing but i guess tts

Goyard Wallet (9/10):  
feels good, cannot add more

Ysl Belt (7/10):  
for that price i cannot expect more

MM6 Wallet (10/10):  
Very nice materials

Asics Gel Kayano 14 (9/10):  
Already have an authentic pair in different colour and while comparing them with each other i could not see differences. Def. recommend and maybe half a size up. Only 9/10 because i a very small red spot on shoe tongue on the left pair

Birkenstocks Boston (9/10):  
def. size up 1 or maybe 2 up, like the asics i already have this pair in authentic and the authentic ones are are definitely bigger, still very good for that price, would suggest buying another pair

Saint DBZ Shirt (10/10):  
big dbz fan, had to get the shirt. a bit big but quality is insane good

arcteryx jacket (9/10):  
def. size up, a bit small at the back, but quality and the look is very good!

The North Face Vest (8/10):  
Unfortunately i bought the Vest in L but it was Asian L and USA M, so its a bit small. Def. size up.  
Am i trippin or ist the top more blueish than black? Quality is nice, would recommend

Stussy Shirts Black & White (7/10):  
Not sure about the shirt, which they use for the print, feels a bit too light but i do not have any other stussy shirts to compare.

AMI beige (8/10):  
def. size up, quality is good, expected a more heavy shirt than that but it's fine

AMI green (8/10):  
same with beige

Carharrt Jacket (10/10):  
favorite piece of my haul, quality is insane good and the sizing is perfect

1l04m56,"Costco, Best Buy, Nike, Walmart, Target and Macy’s among the retailers raising prices as Trump tariffs take hold","> Consumers who hoped tariffs would not hit their wallets keep getting bad news. As they reported earnings in recent weeks, multiple major retailers said they have already raised some prices or plan to hike them in the coming weeks to offset the duties. They include major grocers and consumer goods sellers Costco, Best Buy, Walmart and Target. President Donald Trump’s ever-changing trade policy has roiled retailers as they try to plan their supply chains. On earnings calls, they faced the difficult task of trying to appease investors who want them to protect their bottom lines and shoppers who could balk at price hikes.

> In some cases, companies have been explicit, citing the estimated toll tariffs will take on their bottom lines and breaking down which countries their supply chains rely on. Other retailers have been less forthcoming, avoiding the word “tariff” and instead blaming strategy shifts or price hikes on “macroeconomic uncertainty” — or simply refusing to point the finger at all.

> Many retailers have reduced or withdrawn their full-year guidance because of tariffs. Companies such as Abercrombie & Fitch, Macy’s and Best Buy have slashed their profit outlooks. Meanwhile, American Eagle, Canada Goose, Ross and Mattel pulled their full-year guidance.

> Economists on both sides of the aisle agree that tariffs are inflationary and the cost will likely be passed on to consumers, though government data has not showed a clear effect yet. A majority, 68%, of U.S. CEOs say they have either increased prices already or are considering doing so this year in the face of tariffs, according to a new survey by Chief Executive Group and AlixPartners.

1kw2scn,Naomi Osaka debuts “Sakura” Nike kit that she designed for the 2025 French Open. “Spring is sakura season … the girlies are gonna love this one.”,"The light pink Nike piece featured a mock-neck racerback design and a flowy, layered skirt with a rounded hemline. The burgundy contrast trim on the neck and back added a touch of structure to the soft, romantic silhouette.

During warm-up, Osaka wore a varsity-style Nike jacket, whose main body is a rich burgundy color with a shiny, glossy finish, while the sleeves are pale pink. The trim on the cuffs, collar, and waistband features white and burgundy stripes, enhancing the sporty varsity look.

“The shoes are Sakura-themed, which is just in time for spring, which is Sakura season. It follows the flower story that we have throughout the year,"" said Osaka before the match when speaking with the media. 

Osaka continued, ""I'm really excited about the kit because I designed it. I don't know why Nike is letting me do this stuff. I say this every Slam. But I think it's really adorable.""

""I'm just excited. I don't know if you can see from all the way over here, but I did my nails. They're Sakura-themed too. I'm really sticking to the flower story that we have,"" concluded Osaka.

Her hairstyle featured two puffs on top of her head, each adorned with cherry blossom-like accessories, perfectly tying into her Japanese spring-inspired theme.

1l720zy,Got 3 Shoes instead of 1 Nike,"I'm 20M, and I've never owned a pair of Nike shoes. Since January, I’d been saving up to buy the Nike Dunk Lows, and I managed to save around 5k (coming from a middle-class background). But all the Dunks I liked were priced above 8-9k. So, I gave up on the idea for now and decided to buy three different shoes for different occasions instead.

1st Pair - Urban Blaze: Phantom:
Got these from The Souled Store and I absolutely love the color. These are for college events and special occasions. They're more comfortable than I expected, though the soles could’ve been a bit more cushioned. Other than that, they’re just perfect.
Price: ₹2,500

2nd Pair - Puma ST Runner V4 L (Leather):
Got these from Flipkart for daily college use. They're very comfortable and fit really well. Very soft and cushioned soles and looks slick.
Price: ₹1,700

3rd Pair - Campus Men's Hurricane Running Shoes:
I bought these for the gym and evening walks. They look decent, are quite comfortable, and super lightweight. Perfect for the gym, I'd say.
Price: ₹700

So I spent a total of Rs. 4900 and saved 100 rupees.🥹

1kte5i0,My boyfriend (23M) told me he was “putting me in my place” after a small comment. I (22F) don’t think someone who loves you says that,"We’ve had arguments before, but this one really messed with my head.

So, I made a harmless comment the other day. I told my boyfriend he kinda had a “marathon runner” body — not as an insult, just a light comment. He got annoyed, but I thought it was over.

The next day, I told him I had gone to the gym and ended up vomiting twice — it was a rough session. Instead of checking in on me, he brought up my comment from the night before and threw it in my face: “You say I look like a marathon runner but you can’t even handle one workout? How often do you even go to the gym?”

Then he said something that made my stomach drop: “I’m not comparing, I’m just putting you in your place.”
I don’t even know how to describe how that felt. It was condescending, disrespectful, and it felt like he needed to win something at my expense.

To make it worse, we had talked about how I love cherries the day before — and in the middle of this argument, he goes, “You know what? I’m not getting you cherries. You don’t deserve them.”
What am I, a kid being punished?

I seriously cannot describe it. It is something you really just need to walk around and see. They really put so much effort into their outfits and leave nothing out. You'd probably be executed for wearing a Nike t-shirt, jeans, and running shoes like 90% of the US guys.

1lcoget,What to gift a guy who has everything?,"Hey fellas!
I’m looking for a nice gift for my boyfriend for our 1-year anniversary, but my budget is kinda tight — around ₹1500 only 😭
We’re completing one year soon and I’ve got just one week to buy or order something.

The problem is... he literally already has everything! He uses expensive stuff like Armani Exchange for clothes, Azzaro perfumes, Air Jordans etc.
And then there’s me... a simple, middle-class girl trying to find something thoughtful and usable without selling my kidney 😩

I’ve already gifted him a backpack, wallet, shirt, and tees in the past.
Also, I don’t want to do anything handwritten or overly DIY this time — I want something he can actually use.

Any ideas for something affordable but meaningful or practical? I'm genuinely stuck here 🥲



Edit: A lot of y’all are assuming things 😂 Just to clarify — I’ve never taken money from him. He buys nice stuff for himself, and I’m just trying to give him something thoughtful from my small budget.

1l8fo74,(In-Hand Review) Air Jordan 3 “Pure Money” 2025 (RN Batch) from TMF ✨👟,"Back again with another in-hand review and this time it’s the **Air Jordan 3 “Pure Money” 2025 (RN Batch)!** Let’s get into it 🔍



* This is for informational purposes only. You are entitled to your own opinion of the details I discuss. This review is my opinion of this pair.*


First off… **Shoutout TMF!** What can I say TMF is awesome.  TMF was patient and responsive and helped RL with ease when I needed to… This pair only took 9 days from the GL✅  🔼 ✈️  to my door!  **WhatsApp and W2C Link below my review.** 



⸻

👀 **Appearance:**
Straight out of the box, these are *clean.* The all-white colorway hits hard with the subtle silver accents. It’s got that icy, premium look—super wearable and lowkey but still stands out. The silhouette looks accurate and well-shaped; toe box height is solid. I am pleased with the appearance 😍.

⸻

🖐️ **In Hand Feel:**
The shoe feels sturdy but not overly stiff. Decent weight in hand and does not feel “cheap” IMO. The padding around the ankle is plush, and the tongue has a good padding to it also. The leather is soft but firm. Feels like quality IMO.

⸻

🧵 **Stitching:**
Stitching is tidy and consistent throughout. No crazy flaws or loose threads, but the exterior of the right shoe’s toe elephant print’s double stitching is slightly too spaced. No one will notice this on foot. The double stitch pattern around the midsole and upper panels is clean and uniform though.

⸻

🔝 **Upper Material:**
The upper is a smooth tumbled leather, and it feels soft to the touch—feels above average and good quality. Doesn’t feel plasticky, and it has that nice grainy texture in the right lighting. 

⸻

🐘 **Elephant Print:**
The elephant print is good but could be a bit more consistent. It’s a light off white grayish with white cracks. The scale pattern looks close to what I would anticipate from retail—just the right amount of contrast, but it’s too early to say definitely how retail will be. Placement around the toe is ever slightly inconsistent but no one will notice this on foot. The heel is consistent. This is fine 👍.

⸻

👟 **Heel Tab:**
Jumpman logo and “AIR” text on the heel tab are centered and crisp. No leaning or misalignment. Heel tab material feels sturdy but flexible. Bounces back well when pulled down to show the “Pure$” stitching. 

⸻

🦶 **Sole:**
Outsole is white with grey “JORDAN” lettering that pops out and is aligned correctly.  The traction pattern looks on point. The insole is white with a grey jumpman.

⸻

✅ **Conclusion:**
Overall, this pair is a WIN from **RN.** I was surprised by the quality in hand. For the most part, the shape, materials, and build quality all check out.  This pair will release in 2025, so still a bit early to say how the official release will look next month, but you can wear these with confidence. I feel like this is a super solid cop. **RN delivered!** 🔥

Jumpman logo and “AIR” text on the heel tab are centered and crisp. No leaning or misalignment. Heel tab material feels sturdy but flexible. Bounces back well when pulled down to show the “Pure$” stitching. 

⸻

🦶 **Sole:**
Outsole is white with grey “JORDAN” lettering that pops out and is aligned correctly.  The traction pattern looks on point. The insole is white with a grey jumpman.

⸻

✅ **Conclusion:**
Overall, this pair is a WIN from **RN.** I was surprised by the quality in hand. For the most part, the shape, materials, and build quality all check out.  This pair will release in 2025, so still a bit early to say how the official release will look next month, but you can wear these with confidence. I feel like this is a super solid cop. **RN delivered!** 🔥

1kuvsvl,What makes Jordan the GOAT to you?,"As someone who is going thru Jordan's entire career for the first time, I think he's the GOAT. I've watched highlights dozens of times and now starting to watch full games. For me he's the GOAT not just because of the accolades or 6 rings or even his cultural impact. It's how he plays. He just has that mythical aura around him that he looks like a superhero every time he plays. The swagger as well to his play style, the way he did ball-fakes, dunking over 7 footers.

1l55gb8,[ON-FEET REVIEW] Air Jordan 3 x A Ma Maniére “While You Were Sleeping” (OG Batch) from Zen,"Seller: Zen

Batch: OG

Size: 13

Price: $140 shipped

Shipping Time: 19 days to the EU

🔍 First Impressions

Out of the box, these are luxury in sneaker form. The black tumbled leather hits hard — buttery soft to the touch — and the violet ore suede overlays are perfectly muted but rich. The aged midsole gives them that worn-in, story-driven vibe that A Ma Maniére is known for. Instantly felt like a premium product.

👟 Shape & Build Quality

Toe Box: Clean shape, nice low profile. No toe puffiness or excess bulk.

Heel: Nike Air branding is crisp and placed accurately. Stitching all around is tight.

Panels: Everything aligns nicely — no warping or miscuts. The suede paneling wraps smoothly.

Tongue Height: Slightly shorter than retail, but it works. AMM and Jumpman tags are centered and well-stitched.

🎨 Materials & Color

Leather: Tumbled and soft, feels high-end. No creasing issues even on foot.

Suede: Violet ore suede is luxe. Good texture and color saturation — not ashy or flat.

Lining: That diamond-quilted satin interior is just chef’s kiss. Feels like you're stepping into a designer chair.

Colorway: The combo of black, violet ore, and flat pewter with the vintage sole gives these a heritage-luxury blend that just works. Pops under natural light without being loud.

🧼 Comfort & Fit

Fits true to size (TTS)

Padding around the collar is plush — no break-in needed

Solid heel lock and forefoot room

Feels wearable all day without fatigue

The Air Jordan 3 Retro OG SP A Ma Maniére While You Were Sleeping (Women’s) is a stunning continuation of the celebrated partnership between A Ma Maniére and Jordan Brand. Known for its luxury aesthetics and storytelling, A Ma Maniére delivers yet another masterpiece with this black, violet ore, and flat pewter colorway. The sneaker, part of the larger ""While You Were Sleeping"" collection, stays true to the brand's signature style with premium materials and thoughtful design details. This release carries the same high standard that made the first A Ma Maniére Jordan 3 an instant classic.

This iteration features a black tumbled leather upper paired with premium suede overlays, creating a sophisticated yet edgy look. The violet ore accents subtly elevate the design, adding a unique touch that distinguishes it from other releases. A vintage-inspired midsole and outsole bring a worn-in, timeless vibe that fits perfectly with A Ma Maniére’s carefully curated aesthetic. Details like the Nike Air branding on the heel and the mix of Jumpman and A Ma Maniére logos on the tongues further emphasize the sneaker’s premium appeal. Inside, the diamond-quilted lining delivers that luxurious feel the brand is known for.

Released on August 20, 2024, the Air Jordan 3 Retro OG A Ma Maniére (While You Were Sleeping) edition retailed at $250. With its striking black, flat pewter, and violet ore colorway, this sneaker is the perfect fusion of luxury and heritage. As a highly anticipated drop, it showcases the elevated craftsmanship and storytelling that A Ma Maniére brings to every collaboration. Whether you’re a collector or someone looking to step up your style, this Jordan 3 is a must-have addition to any sneaker rotation.

🧠 Final Thoughts

This OG batch from Zen really brings the A Ma Maniére 3s to life. From materials to shape to feel, it delivers a high-end experience at a fraction of retail. If you're looking for a pair that nails the storytelling and still turns heads on-foot, this is it. Absolutely staying in the rotation.

P.S. This pair is almost 9 months old, one of the first reps I ever got and I’ve worn them quite a bit. They held up tremendously, I gotta hand it to OG factory, these shoes are comfortable and durable.

1kw60ht,Air Jordan 4 SB navy (won in a giveaway from AJ TRendy Sneakers),"I recently had the incredible luck of winning a giveaway from AJ Trendy Sneakers, and I chose the navy colorway of the Jordan SB 4—and wow, these are clean. Right out of the box, I was seriously impressed.

First off, let’s talk about comfort. I’ve worn a lot of sneakers, including several Air Maxes, but these SB 4s might actually become my new daily beaters. The cushioning is on another level—soft, responsive, and incredibly supportive. Whether you’re skating, walking all day, or just rocking them casually, the comfort is ridiculously on point. I honestly didn’t expect them to feel this good.

Now on to quality. These come from LJR batch, and to be honest, I had to double and triple check them to find any flaws… but there just weren’t any. No loose threads, no glue stains, no weird stitching. The shape, the materials, even the smell—everything feels super close to retail. If you didn’t tell me these weren’t from a Nike store, I wouldn’t know the difference.

Huge shoutout to Repsneakersdogs and AJ Trendy Sneakers for blessing me with this pair. They absolutely nailed it with this drop. I can already tell these SB 4s are going to be in heavy rotation in my lineup. Classic look, unbeatable comfort, and top-tier quality. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

If you’re thinking about picking up a pair—don’t hesitate. These are the real deal.

1lawm0p,[ON-FEET REVIEW] Air Jordan 1 x Union LA “Chicago Shadow” (PK) from Zen,"**Seller:** Zen

**Batch:** PK

**Size:** 13

**Price:** \$140 shipped

**Shipping Time:** 19 days to the EU

---

🔍 **First Impressions**

Straight heat. The Union “Chicago Shadow” colorway might be the best mashup Jordan Brand never officially released — and this PK batch from Zen hits the mark in all the right places. Toe box is clean, stitching is accurate, and the color blocking is as striking as ever. In hand, it feels premium, aged, and ready to rock.

👟 **Shape & Build Quality**

* **Toe Box:** Nicely shaped — slim and properly sloped. No ballooning or toe puff issues.
* **Stitching:** Yellow zigzag exposed stitching at the collar line is clean, evenly spaced, and dead-on to retail pairs.
* **Heel Structure:** Firm, holds shape, and transitions smoothly from the grey upper to the sail midsole.
* **Wings Logo:** Crisp and clean embossing in the right location — no fading or misalignment.
* **Union Tag:** Small, sharp, and properly sewn right into the collar seam.

🎨 **Materials & Color**

* **Leather:** Red forefoot and white panels are tumbled with good texture — soft, not plasticky.
* **Black/Grey Panels:** Smooth matte finish, with that muted Shadow 1 look — no gloss, no over-dye.
* **Tongue:** Vintage sail nylon with exposed foam, feels authentically aged but not overdone.
* **Laces:** Comes with **three sets total**:

  * Two-tone **black/cream**
  * Two-tone **grey/black**
  * Solid **Union yellow** — fire accent for swaps.
* **Midsole:** Sail tone adds that aged vibe without going full pre-yellowed.

🧼 **Comfort & Fit**

* Fits true to size (TTS)
* Classic Jordan 1 comfort — flat, but supportive
* Slightly padded tongue and good collar support
* Break-in is minimal — feels wearable out of the box

⚡ **LORE:**

The Union LA x Air Jordan 1 “Chicago Shadow” is a grail-tier remix that never saw a retail release — a true what-if mashup of the “Chicago” toe and the “Shadow” upper, imagined through Chris Gibbs’ vintage thrifted lens. The original 2018 Union collab helped shift sneaker culture toward aged, boutique-inspired design with raw stitching, sail midsoles, and exposed foams.

This colorway in particular feels like a collector’s dream — aged leather, mismatched materials, and a bold but wearable palette. PK’s batch captures every stitch and panel like it came straight out of Union’s LA vault.

🧠 **Final Thoughts**

This is one of the cleanest Union variants out there, and PK didn’t miss. Zen came through with a well-shaped, well-built, and highly detailed version of a pair most people wish got a wider release. From the triple lace set to the aged finish and premium materials, this is a standout piece in any Jordan rotation.

For the price I’m happy with. The leather is tumbled and soft. A little more tumbled than retail and I’m sure the EP could be better but on foot they are fine. There is another batch that had probably a little bit better leather with the same EP but it’s double the price.  

They are super comfortable I’ll say that though. Don’t know if that’s just a AJ3 thing or this pair itself.

1l7xyk5,"[Glasspiegel] Smith added that Jordan will call him to disagree with things he said on-air, and while he’s not as aggressive about it as Kobe Bryant used to be, he’s “candid.”
“I don’t think he’s going to be shy about saying what he sees—at all,” Smith concluded.","Stephen A. Smith doesn’t think Michael Jordan will hold back his true thoughts on TV.

At upfronts last month, NBC announced that Jordan would be a special contributor when it resumes its NBA coverage later this year. Basketball fans have been cautiously optimistic that we will get the version of Jordan from the Last Dance documentary, where he chomped cigars and was ruthless about rivals and critics, as opposed to a politician hesitant to offend his constituents.

Smith appeared on Patrick Bet-David’s PBD Podcast last week and made it sound like Jordan, whom he talks to with some regularity, is ready to speak with candor. 

“Let me tell you something about Michael Jordan: He’s going to be brutally honest—I can assure you that,” Smith said. “He’s not going to be somebody who’s going to be passive. … The Michael Jordan I know, when talking basketball, he is as candid as it gets. He ain’t trying to hurt nobody’s feelings. He ain’t trying to be insulting—but he’s going to tell you what’s going on.” 

“I don’t think he’s going to be passive at all. I really, really don’t, and I’m actually proud of him for doing it because, with the Jordan brand and him being worth over $2 billion, he don’t need this,” Smith continued. 

Smith said he urged Jordan to take on more public commentary, telling him to “stop acting like you have nothing to say about basketball now that you’re retired—you talk about it all the damn time!” 

Smith added Jordan will call him to disagree with things he said on-air, and while he’s not as aggressive about it as Kobe Bryant used to be, he’s “candid.”

“I don’t think he’s going to be shy about saying what he sees—at all,” Smith concluded. “As a matter of fact, if he is, he’s going to have to deal with me because I’m going to be in his ear telling him, ‘You’re getting shy now. That’s what we’re doing? That ain’t the MJ I know!’”

Elsewhere in the segment, Bet-David referenced internet rumors that NBC is paying Jordan $40 million annually. A source tells Front Office Sports that this number, which is about twice what Charles Barkley makes per year from TNT, is inaccurate. NBC declined to comment.

“I don’t think he’s going to be shy about saying what he sees—at all,” Smith concluded. Stephen A. Smith doesn’t think Michael Jordan will hold back his true thoughts on TV.

At upfronts last month, NBC announced that Jordan would be a special contributor when it resumes its NBA coverage later this year. Basketball fans have been cautiously optimistic that we will get the version of Jordan from the Last Dance documentary, where he chomped cigars and was ruthless about rivals and critics, as opposed to a politician hesitant to offend his constituents.

Smith appeared on Patrick Bet-David’s PBD Podcast last week and made it sound like Jordan, whom he talks to with some regularity, is ready to speak with candor. 

“Let me tell you something about Michael Jordan: He’s going to be brutally honest—I can assure you that,” Smith said. “He’s not going to be somebody who’s going to be passive. … The Michael Jordan I know, when talking basketball, he is as candid as it gets.

1l810s8,"TDIH: 10.06, 1967, following just 6 days of fighting, the Six-Day War has ended with an overwhelming Israeli victory, against multiple Arab nations. Here are some less known photos from the IDF's collection in their website.","Following Egypt's declaration of war by blocking naval routes, calling up UN peacekeepers to leave, and the making of genocidal threats, together with Syria encouraging terrorists, and threatening to cut the Jordan river's water source, Israel has decided to launch a surprise attack instead of waiting for it's enemies to strike on their terms.

Israeli air force managed to surprise the Egyptian, Syrians, Jordanians and Iraqis, crippling their capabilities, and getting a huge advantage in a risky gambit.

Following the victory, Israel has expanded it's territory by multiple sizes. It got ahold on the Golan Heights, where Syrians have been using the high ground to indiscriminately bomb Israeli civilians for years (During ""Cease fires""). It united Jerusalem, got control over the West Bank, and of course the entire Sinai.

Israel wanted to negotiate for peace and recognition, but the Arabs (Including the Arabs of Palestine) met for the Khartoum Resolution, which included No peace with Israel, No negotiation with Israel, No recognition of Israel.

Despite this, Jordan eventually gave up on their claims to the West Bank, stripping many Palestinians from their citizenship (Israel ended up offering the majority of it for the Arabs living there on multiple occasions, but all offers were rejected so far) and making peace.  
  
Egypt also gave up on their eternal war, and eventually agreed to recognize Israel and have peace with it in return of the Sinai (Minus Gaza which they did not want back).

And pretty much only Syria refused up to this day, despite offers continuing up to the 90s. And at this point today, the Golan Heights have been Israeli over 3 times the time they were Syrian.

To sum it up, this war has greatly shaped the area, and it's consequences effect us all here to this day.

🚹 **Customer service was top notch:**

The whole conversation was smooth and every question I asked met my needs. They use high quality and most reliable shipping services like Fedex, DHL, Aramex, Royal Mail etc. After your package is shipped, they will provide you a tracking code within few days where you can track your package.

QC photos are of high quality, taken from all angles (360 degress) where you can inspect the condition from every angle and quickly decide whether it is GL or RL. If you are not satisfied with QC photos, my suggestion is to always for more pictures or daylight condition photos.

They have no problem listening to advice or even if you RL a pair, they are willing to change to a new pair until they finally reach your satisfaction. If there is any problems with the seller, you can contact me privately. Good luck!

**REVIEW**

AJ TRENDY SNEAKERS is an amazing seller!! They went above and beyond to help me with my transaction, and the whole shipping journey, they kept me posted to be sure I knew exactly where my package was.. Hands down some of the best service I have ever gotten from a seller!! They are so polite and just GREAT!! And I’ve used many sellers, so for me to say this, means something!! Trust me when I say, they are ANAZING!! Shipping was provided through USPS , and took some time to get here, not the sellers fault at all!! I personally am ok with that, as long as they arrive and safely arrive, 2 weeks is perfect!! The seller has zero control once they ship them out, but they did update me along the way!! 

**SNEAKERS**

These GX undefeated 4s are excellent, and they are so close to a retail pair it’s insane! The over all quality is perfect!! No flaws , just an amazing sneaker!! I’ll let you decide from the photos what you think..

1l959hg,**\[ON-FEET REVIEW] Air Jordan 1 High x Travis Scott “Mocha” (LJR Batch) from Shoe Tim**,"**Seller:** Shoe Tim

**Batch:** LJR

**Size:** 13

**Price:** \$130 shipped

**Shipping Time:** 17 days to the EU

---

🔍 **First Impressions**

These hit hard right out the gate. That backward Swoosh never gets old — and this LJR batch delivers the Travis “Mocha” vibe *perfectly*. Suede is rich and brushable, and the sail midsole has just the right amount of vintage tint. Shape looks great in-hand and even better on foot. Definitely feels like a top-tier rep.

👟 **Shape & Build Quality**

* **Toe Box:** Slim and properly sloped. No chunky bulge or collapsing — clean profile.
* **Reverse Swoosh:** Great curve and placement. Slight overhang on the lateral edge just like retail.
* **Heel Embroidery:** Cactus Jack face is sharp and centered, not warped or oversized.
* **Collar/Wings Logo:** Nice embossing, solid ankle padding. Wings logo is crisp with correct spacing.

🎨 **Materials & Color**

* **Suede:** That mocha brown hits *perfectly* — soft to the touch with visible stroke motion. No bald spots or stiffness.
* **White Leather:** Tumbled with a natural texture. Doesn’t look plastic or overly smooth.
* **Sail Midsole:** Clean cream tone — not overly yellowed like some batches. Balances out the upper well.
* **Details:** Cactus Jack text on the medial side is faint and placed correctly. Comes with all four lace options: pink, black, red, sail.

🧼 **Comfort & Fit**

* Fits true to size (TTS)
* Classic AJ1 feel — supportive but flat. Breaks in nicely within a wear or two.
* No heel slip, padding around the collar holds the foot in well
* Great everyday comfort if you’re used to 1s

⚡ **LORE:**

The Air Jordan 1 High OG x Travis Scott “Mocha” was one of the most disruptive collabs of the 2010s. Dropped in 2019, it flipped the iconic AJ1 design with a reversed Swoosh, earthy tones, and hidden stash pockets — instantly cementing its status as a modern classic.

The Mocha colorway blends rugged utility with streetwear luxury, and Travis’s influence is felt in every detail. This sneaker helped push Jordan retros into the hands of a new wave of fans and solidified La Flame’s role in sneaker culture.

This LJR batch brings that same iconic look to life, with accurate materials, solid shape, and the same visual punch that made the retail version a grail. If you missed out, this is the next best thing — no cap.

🧠 **Final Thoughts**

LJR does numbers on this one. Shape is on point, suede feels luxe, and all the Travis details are faithfully done. For \$130 shipped, you’re getting something that punches way above its price tag. Whether it’s your first rep or a rotation mainstay, this pair absolutely earns its spot.

* **Suede:** That mocha brown hits *perfectly* — soft to the touch with visible stroke motion. No bald spots or stiffness.
* **White Leather:** Tumbled with a natural texture. Doesn’t look plastic or overly smooth.
* **Sail Midsole:** Clean cream tone — not overly yellowed like some batches. Balances out the upper well.
* **Details:** Cactus Jack text on the medial side is faint and placed correctly. Comes with all four lace options: pink, black, red, sail.

🧼 **Comfort & Fit**

* Fits true to size (TTS)
* Classic AJ1 feel — supportive but flat. Breaks in nicely within a wear or two.
* No heel slip, padding around the collar holds the foot in well
* Great everyday comfort if you’re used to 1s

⚡ **LORE:**

The Air Jordan 1 High OG x Travis Scott “Mocha” was one of the most disruptive collabs of the 2010s. Dropped in 2019, it flipped the iconic AJ1 design with a reversed Swoosh, earthy tones, and hidden stash pockets — instantly cementing its status as a modern classic.

The Mocha colorway blends rugged utility with streetwear luxury, and Travis’s influence is felt in every detail. This sneaker helped push Jordan retros into the hands of a new wave of fans and solidified La Flame’s role in sneaker culture.

This LJR batch brings that same iconic look to life, with accurate materials, solid shape, and the same visual punch that made the retail version a grail. If you missed out, this is the next best thing — no cap.

🧠 **Final Thoughts**

LJR does numbers on this one. Shape is on point, suede feels luxe, and all the Travis details are faithfully done. For \$130 shipped, you’re getting something that punches way above its price tag. Whether it’s your first rep or a rotation mainstay, this pair absolutely earns its spot.

We have received a pair of authentic ones from the factory in China ,what are your thoughts ??let's take a look first.

✅First The materials is like butter and you can get a tumble leather one this .There is no doubt that the PK factory uses premium quality materials, which makes it difficult for people to tell that it is a rep at first glance.

✅From different angles, the shape of the PK 5.0 and retail one  looks slimmer than the market batch , and the market batch looks bulky.

🔎Zooming in on the midsole, the pk 5.0 and the retail one appear to be light yellow, while the market version is darker in yellow color.

✅About the back heel ,for market batch The stitching is not even   and the fragment logo is far from the top, pk5.0 and the retail one are almost the same.

✅The sole of the market version is darker, the fragment blue of the PK and retail is more pure.

Finally, regarding tooling code, we have noticed a lot of customer feedback about font errors last year, which have been fixed in pk 5.0. I believe this version will not disappoint you.

1l0yk5k,[REVIEW] Air Jordan 4 Retro 'Midnight Navy' from Mr Li 🔥🔥🔥,"✍️ **Brief description:**

The Air Jordan 4 Retro ‘Midnight Navy’ dresses the legacy silhouette in the same color blocking used on the OG ‘Fire Red’ colorway. The upper is constructed from white leather with black support wings, a matching black heel tab with embossed Jumpman branding, and navy molded eyelets. A second Jumpman icon adorns the woven tongue tag in crimson. The sneaker rides on a two-tone polyurethane midsole, featuring encapsulated Air in the forefoot and a visible unit in the heel.

The whole conversation was smooth and every question I asked met my needs. They use high quality and most reliable shipping services like Fedex, DHL, Aramex, Royal Mail etc. After your package is shipped, they will provide you a tracking code within few days where you can track your package.

QC photos are of high quality, taken from all angles (360 degress) where you can inspect the condition from every angle and quickly decide whether it is GL or RL. If you are not satisfied with QC photos, my suggestion is to always for more pictures or daylight condition photos.

They have no problem listening to advice or even if you RL a pair, they are willing to change to a new pair until they finally reach your satisfaction. If there is any problems with the seller, you can contact me privately. Good luck!

The 2025 Air Jordan 5 Retro “Fire Red” (Black Tongue) is a highly anticipated reissue of the original 1990 colorway, set to release on September 13, 2025, in full family sizes. This edition celebrates the 35th anniversary of the Air Jordan 5 and aims to deliver a faithful recreation of the OG design. ￼ ￼

Key Features:

	•	Colorway: White/Fire Red-Black

	•	Upper: Premium white leather with side mesh netting

	•	Tongue: Black fabric tongue featuring a red Jumpman logo

	•	Accents: Fire Red details on the midsole, lace lock, and sock liner

	•	Branding: Nike Air logo embroidered on the heel

	•	Numbering: Michael Jordan’s number “23” stitched in red on the lateral heel

	•	Outsole: Translucent rubber outsole ￼ ￼ ￼

This release also features a refined shape with a shallower toe box and pinched heel, closely resembling the 1990 original and enhancing wearability . ￼

**REVIEW**

These sneakers are of very high quality, Y3 did a great job, and got these extremely close to Retail.

•Materials- The leather quality is very good on these

•Color- The shoes are nearly identical to a retail pair

•Tongue/Logo- The Jordan Logo is spot on to a retail pair

•Shape- The shape of the shoe is extremely close to Retail

•Overall, I would rate these a 9.5/10 and that’s only because I’ve not held a retail pair in hand yet, but from the photos I’ve seen, and comparing them to other retail Jordan 5s, I have no complaints!

**SERVICE**

Shoe Tim continues to show exceptional service! He always chooses the best sneakers from the factory, and they come flawless!! He wraps them in a plastic wrap, to ensure there is no damage upon shipping, and it helps keep the shoes from rubbing against one another.. I highly recommend giving Shoe Tim a try if you haven’t already! He communicates very well, and has compassion about what he does, If you don’t like the sneakers he simply returns them until your satisfied(This is yet to happen for me) because the shoes he chooses are perfect!

1l9pp00,REVIEW / On Foot / Air Jordan / Retro 5 / Fire Red “Black tongue” / Y3 🔥/ From - Shoe Tim,"After Wearing this pair several times, I felt it’s time to do an on foot review… I will say , Y3 has performed very well!! They are extremely comfortable, and probably one of my newest favorite pair of sneakers! I am so happy with this purchase from Shoe Tim! Let’s get into it… 

**Materials:**. The leather quality on these is fantastic, premium, and soft, but does not crease.

•Tongue- great material, feels good

•Side cage- very good , feels premium 

• Leather- very soft , doesn’t crease 

•Lace lock- Heavy duty, same as retail 

**Comfort** These are the most comfortable pair of Jordan Retro 5s I have ever put on my feet, can wear all day without any issues , or feet hurting!

**Sizing** These are TTS , fit my feet very well!

**Details** I haven’t had a Retail pair in hands, but they look very good! 
  
•Side cage- placed well , like retail

•Tongue- Jordan sign is good, Thick tongue , 

• Color- Colors look good, same as retail

• Shape- Over all shape looks good , close to retail



**OVERALL**  I will rate this pair a 9.5/ 10 , and the only reason they aren’t getting a 10, is because I haven’t had a retail pair to compare them to, I will say I haven’t LJR Jordan 5s, and the Y3 feels much better on my feet, the quality is just crazy good! If you have questioned yourself on whether or not Y3 is a good choice, I 100% will buy more Y3 version Jordan Retro 5s… I took photos in different lighting so hopefully you can see what I see in person, Unfortunately you can’t feel what I feel on foot, but it’s Wonderful!! No exaggeration, Extremely Comfortable!!

1l6mlzv,Air Max 1’s are the most uncomfortable shoe I’ve bought in the last ten years.,"Visiting my sister in New York City. Forgot my Hoka Clifton 9’s, so I ended up only having my Nike Air Max 1’s to walk all over the city with. 

Let me preface this with yes, I know that generally speaking the Air Max 1 these days is more of a fashion shoe than a comfort one. Also, I had a pair of Air Max back in the early aughts that was really comfortable and cushy. But it’s still a brand new shoe, from one of the biggest companies on earth, and it’s *supposedly* got a giant air bag on the heel for comfort while walking. 

Let me tell you, I just walked probably 5-7 miles, throughout the city, and the balls of my feet are a freaking wreck. I honestly feel like I was wearing dress shoes or no shoes at all. 

I’m absolutely baffled at just how uncomfortable a supposed walking/running shoe can be. I know the Air Max tech is old, but I have to believe that Nike can improve the foam and therefore, the ride. They must just not give a shit. 

This 100% gives me pause on buying *anything* Nike ever again. 

Do I have a weird foot? Did I just happen to get a bad pair? Or is this par for the course with the new Nike Air Max?",RipplesOfDivinity,1749415996.0,2025-06-08 20:53:16,0,0.38,16,Sneakers,https://i.redd.it/wmteeclxnr5f1.jpeg,https://reddit.com/r/Sneakers/comments/1l6mlzv/air_max_1s_are_the_most_uncomfortable_shoe_ive/,Nike Air Max,"Air Max 1’s are the most uncomfortable shoe I’ve bought in the last ten years.

1laosvi,AirMax 90 dúvidas,"Basicamente to com 1k p comprar um tenis e to apaixonado no airmax 90 branco com roxo, porém to com medo de comprar o tamanho errado porq vi mt gente criticando que ele tem uma forma menor.

Meu pé maior tem 27cm de comprimento e 12/13cm de largura. Geralmente eu compro tenis tamanho 42. Se eu for comprar o AirMax90, posso dale no 42 mesmo ou é melhor o 43?

Outra coisa, vi umas postagens mai antigas do sub dizendo que ele é desconfortavel para o dia a dia e já umas recentes que ele é confortavel. Eu ando uma média de 5 a 10km por dia, mas minha prioridade é usar ele para role, para andar eu tenho um olympikus fuleiro e pretendo investir em um ultraboost daqui uns meses, mas até lá queria usar o airmax se possivel, ele é realmente desconfortavel ou dá p dale? 

Agradeço quem der essa atenção, to com o dinheiro na conta p comprar isso q eu quero q chegue antes do dia 28. Sei que compra online (afinal nao tem essa cor em loja presencial do meu estado) tem direito a arrependimento até 7 dias, mas vi varias reclamções que nao da p contar com a nike nesse quesito, é isso mesmo?

My second purchase with RepMaster via HooBuy. RM was easy to communicate with and answered any questions. They would have arrived quicker if I bought directly through him. Top bloke producing the goods! 

I finally have one of my all time favourite sneaks. The materials are unreal, real texture, amazing attention to detail even with the Velcro and just a  stunning pair. There is a tint of yellow on the midsole but not sure how much this varies with the retail pair. 

Thank you dogs for your support! This was my third purchase just over a month and there’s many more to come 🥳

1l75nly,Just do it.,"Just wanted to come on here and share a huge win for me. I have had insomnia for over 5 years. Sometimes not sleeping for 4-5 days at a time, only being able to sleep in my own bed/ not go on vacations or trips with my friends, living in complete and total fear of sleep deprivation to the point where it controlled every aspect of my life. My insomnia is due to anxiety/ fear of sleep loss (the fear of spending 1,2,3,4,5, days without sleep makes me so scared that I can't sleep), so this piece of advice may not be super applicable to those who experience medical insomnia. Anyways: I have avoided going on trips, vacations, sleeping over at anyone's house, and going out in general because I was scared to spend the next day sleepless. I booked a trip with my friends, and spent the following 4 months terrified, dreading this trip. At the last minute, I decided ""I can't do it. I won't sleep at all. I will have an awful time. My friends will have to take me back home and I will ruin it for everyone."", so I stayed behind while they left. As I was sitting in my apartment, I heard a voice say ""just do it. GO. You are 23 years old. You can't let this take away your fun, your memories, your life. Even if you don't sleep for 4 days you won't die, at least you can say you tried. You can't keep isolating yourself like this."" So I stopped what I was doing, got up and started packing. With all the motivation in me to live my life, and all the fear that this disorder would kill me, I drove all the way there myself. I did not sleep the first night, but I had an amazing day even without sleep. I was able to do everything that my friends did, and even had time to take a cat nap. You wouldn't believe what pushing myself as hard as I could did for me: I slept. I SLEPT ON THE TRIP!!! I expanded my capacity to go beyond what I thought I could do. I tired myself out by having such a good time in a different state, seeing things that I have never seen before. I made sure to have my own private room so that I could have my space to feel anxiety and do the things that made me feel comforted in my own home. It was not 8 hours of deep sleep, more like 4 hours, but that's normal for trips! I slept the third night even BETTER than the second too. I am so proud of myself, and I am ready to keep facing the fear of not sleeping and leaving my comfort zone. So here is my advice to those of you who experience sleep anxiety: JUST DO IT. GO ON THAT TRIP. A FEW DAYS WITHOUT SLEEP WON'T KILL YOU!

1kxi2yw,AITA for eating ice cream every night just like I always do and not stopping just bc my SIL doesn't want my niece to see it?,"Most nights after dinner, I eat a small ice cream cone. It’s literally the little “joy mini cups” with a teeny scoop of ice cream. Maybe a big scoop if I’m having a rough day but that’s kinda rare. I don’t drink alcohol or smoke weed or do anything “fun” so this is my one fun thing I do for myself. 

My brother and his wife and daughter are staying with me for a few weeks, they’ll be gone by June 15. I’m happy to have them here. Usually we’ll eat dinner together and go our separate ways for the evening. They watch a lot of TV so they’re usually all in the living room watching. 

I’ve been eating my lil cone, but my sister in law approached me and asked me if I could stop. She said that my niece is starting to ask why she doesn’t get to have ice cream and that obviously she was lied to by my sister in law when she told her ice cream is a sometimes food, haha. 

I said that I wasn’t going to stop but I could wait until she was in bed. I figured that was a good compromise and I do get that she’s trying to raise her little girl to have a healthy relationship with food. But waiting until she was in bed didn’t work because she came into the kitchen multiple times to ask me for some. 

My SIL was definitely a little incredulous over it and kept saying “Really? Do you seriously NEED to eat ice cream every single day?” or stuff like it. I said no, but she also doesn’t need to drink a glass of wine every day either. She didn’t like this and sighed a bunch and has been visibly annoyed with me since then. My brother asked me if I could stop just to avoid the drama, but I said I deserve my little treats. AITA?

  
**Hi so I've decided to log off this post and not come back.** This post has just gotten completely out of control with really over the top overreactions and people trying to encourage me to make things worse or escalate and call my sil an alcoholic or to purposely eat more ice cream in front of my niece. Some of you are just like chomping at the bit to call people names and be sarcastic and nasty to me for no reason. That's not really what I was expecting and we're not allowed to delete posts so I'm just going to log out and move on.

### What just happened isn’t just “wrong” it’s **illegal** and **dangerous**.

Brad Lander wasn’t resisting.  
He wasn’t rioting.  
He wasn’t breaking anything.

He was exercising the rights that every American is *supposed* to have:  
- Ask for a warrant  
- Stand beside a neighbor  
- Question a badge

> **If the government can arrest an elected official for that, no one is safe.**

---

### This is what fascism looks like:

- **Mask-wearing agents** dragging people out of court  
- **No warrants. No IDs. No oversight.**  
- **Political officials arrested for doing the right thing**

And don’t forget this didn’t happen in some distant border town.  
It happened in **Manhattan.** At an **immigration court.** On U.S. soil. In broad daylight.

---

### What You Can Do:

**Share this story** before it disappears from the news cycle  
**Demand accountability**: call your reps & demand a congressional ICE investigation  
Support [Make the Road NY](https://maketheroadny.org/) and [ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project](https://www.aclu.org/issues/immigrants-rights)  
Organize. Protest. Refuse to stay quiet.

Brad Lander wasn’t resisting.  
He wasn’t rioting.  
He wasn’t breaking anything.

He was exercising the rights that every American is *supposed* to have:  
- Ask for a warrant  
- Stand beside a neighbor  
- Question a badge

> **If the government can arrest an elected official for that, no one is safe.**

---

### This is what fascism looks like:

- **Mask-wearing agents** dragging people out of court  
- **No warrants. No IDs. No oversight.**  
- **Political officials arrested for doing the right thing**

And don’t forget this didn’t happen in some distant border town.  
It happened in **Manhattan.** At an **immigration court.** On U.S. soil. In broad daylight.

---

### What You Can Do:

**Share this story** before it disappears from the news cycle  
**Demand accountability**: call your reps & demand a congressional ICE investigation  
Support [Make the Road NY](https://maketheroadny.org/) and [ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project](https://www.aclu.org/issues/immigrants-rights)  
Organize. Protest. Refuse to stay quiet.

1lgtxrl,"Our daughter said that my partner (28F) is her mother, and I (27F) am not. My partner said she just told her the truth, and it doesn't matter, but why would she say something like this, and how do I deal with it?","My partner and I have been together for nine years. It isn't legally recognised to be married where we live, but we would be if we could. I know some people would assume we have commitment issues or something like that, but that's the way it is. We have two daughters. One is four, and the other is six months old.

Biologically, they are completely hers. Other than the donor. We do not know their identity, but our children can request it as adults. We had it done in a neighbouring country, because they are hesitant about doing it for people in our situation here. I love children, but I didn't want to be pregnant, and it's a very long process. She did want to, so it worked out well.

I am in the post graduate stage at the moment of being a doctor. It's what I've always wanted, and it's important to me that we are in the position where our children can do whatever they want in the future as well. I also really enjoy it, it's interesting, and while it's a lot of work, it's worth it to me.

I do try to help and spend as much time with the children as I can. It can be hard though because of the hours I have to work. Some of my colleagues are more understanding, I am lucky to work in quite a modern place, so I do get better hours most of the time, but it still isn't ideal.

I try to at least help either every morning or evening, I bath them, I dress them, I read to them, I play with them, I take them places, I really do try to be as present as possible. I don't want to be the parent who's always working. I also try to help my partner obviously, I clean, I cook meals, I do those sorts of things as well.

About a week ago, I was putting our older daughter to bed. She said, why is my partner (I will use that because she calls us both different names, which is both personal and it would get confusing) with you, and not my father. I said that we have talked about this. And she said yes, and my partner had said to her I'm not her mother, and she is. And that she doesn't understand why my partner was weird and was with me and not her father.

Obviously, children can get confused. So I talked to my partner and asked why our daughter said this, and why she thought this. We have discussed with her before when she has asked how it works, why she has two mothers, and it never involved who was the 'real' mother. She knows my partner gave birth to her, she's seen photos of her pregnant and things like that,  but she's little, she doesn't really understand what that means.

My partner said she had just told her the truth when she had asked, and I asked why. She said that we can't lie and act like we're the same because we're not, and it's only going to confuse her. I said that she's not confused, that her 'father' is irrelevant in this because he's not her father, and all she did was centre everything around her and act like I don't matter.

She said I'm making it into something significant when it's not, and that she did far more than I have ever done, and that neither of our children would be here without her. And that's true. But it feels like she doesn't care about everything I have done, and the worst thing for me is that she would tell our child these sorts of things. It really upsets me that now, she might see as different, and that's all because of what she said to her. 

I don't know why she suddenly thinks so differently to me, when we never had this before. Maybe there's something I can't see, maybe something is wrong, I don't know, but I didn't think there was.

1lf0wh2,Do I (27f) just accept that my fiancé (35m) can only pay a small portion of the bills and not question it?,"TLDR: My fiancé gets angry when i talk about money, currently we need to move to a bigger place for his daughter and he refuses to pay 50/50. Do I just accept that he can only pay a small portion of the bills and not question it despite his good income?

For context:

My fiancé and I have lived together for five months now. Currently I pay a majority of the bills about 70/30. Which I agreed to as this was my apartment first and was supposed to be temporary until we found a bigger place. (The plan was to split bills 50/50 when we moved). We are at a point now that we really need a bigger place. He has a daughter we have on the weekends and currently she is sleeping in the living room. 

When I asked him how much he can afford in rent he told me $600 a month TOTAL for his half of rent/electricity/Wi-Fi. He makes $65k annually usd, and has minimal other bills. Also prior to moving in with me, he paid $1100 a month in rent alone. So I’m not sure why now he can only afford $600. 

A few times now, I have asked him to sit down  with me and create a budget. As he makes enough money to pay more than $600 a month in bills. And quite frankly that won’t even cover half the rent for a 2 bedroom apartment in my city much less the added costs of utilities and WiFi. Every time this happens, he gets angry, yells at me accusing me of being judgmental when it comes to money and storms off. When truly all I care about is making sure that we get a bigger place with a room for his daughter. He refuses to make a budget and says that it’s unnecessary and that he’s a grown man who has never had to have one. 

At this point, I believe he just expects me to shoulder paying more in bills and I feel a little used. I do make more money but not by much (75k usd). I’m just not sure what to do at this point do I just accept the amount he gave me and not question it? However, that puts me in a situation where I’m paying a majority of the bills, which I don’t feel is fair.

1lg8gqx,Its fine if Kids like the show just PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BRING YOUR CHILDREN TO CONS!,"
Bringing your kid to a *Helluva Boss* or *Hazbin Hotel* convention isn’t cute or cool — it just makes things awkward for the cast. I’ve seen people get mad because a cast member made a sex joke in response to a kid’s question, but honestly, what do you expect? The joke was tame, too. All they said was, “Blitzø’s favorite animal is one he can ride,” followed by, “It’s NOT a horse! 😏” They could’ve said much worse.

The point is, if you’re going to be offended by adult humor, don’t bring your kid to an adult-themed convention. It’s that simple.
I mean if your kid is a fan of the show that's fine, I mean you can't stop kids from like it. I liked south park when I was 7 I can't be talking.

They can clearly write romance as indicated by lots of people liking Parvatis romance quest. But they will NOT do it for players at all cost if they can help it.  
  
The biggest reason I have ever been given is they “don't feel the can deliver a good quality romance and thus decide not to do it it” when I cant help but point out that them not being perfect has never prevented them from including lots of other mechanics.

I play their games often in SPITE of their numerous weird if not outright bad gameplay mechanics.

But for some reason they can include those no matter how haphazardly they cobbled them together, but romance? Nah that they wont do cause they cant make it “good enough” apparently?

Which, gonna be real, they are never gonna get better or improve in their romance writing if they just never tackle it.

Straight up, I want romances in my RPGs games okay? In particular if you make companions a big deal, as they tend to do, it feels outright strange to me how adamantly they refuse to just let us romance them no matter what. I know I am not alone in this. People LOVE themselves an RPG romance. But for some reason every time people point out Obsidian refuses to do them it goes “oh, that is just how they are” as if this is some minor quirk.

Which, fair enough if it is for you, but I loved a LOT of RPGs for their romances. I would have still probably enjoyed Blauds Gate 3 without the several amazing romance options, but significantly less so.

And to some degree I gotta think if the reasoning REALLY is this “I don’t wanna under deliver” mindset in regard to it, I cant help but think that not doing it AT ALL is not much of an improvement.

Especially since again, they in my mind HAVE shown they can do romance, but just refuse to let players be the one who participate in them rather than just the companions and NPCs.

1lcgz9e,Why do people keep dismissing this game by saying it's just a copy of Poppy Playtime ?,"Seriously, I want to understand that criticism because the only thing I see that are similar are :

1. You walk around in an abandoned area

2. You get chased by ennemies

3. It's a free roam 3d game

4. There are cardboard cutouts which make noises

5. There are puzzles for you to solve

  
But when you actually look at the differences, you can see that :

1. This game emphasises exploration by letting you explore a building and even backtrack to certain areas with a realistic layout and shortcuts that can even lead you to optional secret areas, instead of going from just point A to point B.

2. The stealth sections are a lot more creative with them having only one enemy that can appear in any costume, blending well with the different areas. They also vary in how you have to progress through them in the game, for example by either gathering missing pieces or animatronic parts.

3. The gameplay also varies with different and creative chase sequences like with Big top and Dollie.

4. You have collectables which lets you achieve a secret ending with an unique inventory system.

5. The puzzles are still very different and unique from the ones in Poppy playtime.

5. There's still supernatural elements in this game, like with the Tiger rock costume seemingly being haunted chasing you in the basement section.

6. There are multiple endings.

I'm talking about buying from places that are much cheaper than high street opticians, like Goggles4u! 

Is this acceptable, because you've paid for a test, and we don't owe them anything more than that, and how else can you get your prescription?  

Or the lowest of the low? Is it even worse if you get a discounted eye test deal?!?

1ktxe6a,Yo! Wdywt? I got my Nike SB Dunk “Jarritos” on,"(Text is from an old review, one of my first ones)

••LORE••

The Nike SB Dunk Low Jarritos weaves its rich history and signature colors into a canvas and leather Dunk inspired by the original canvas bags used to harvest the vibrant fruits that drive the brand’s unique flavors. Using custom insole art, bold colors, and their iconic green and orange hues, the SB Dunk Low Jarritos pays homage to culture, tradition, and craft. Along with three lace options, co-branded tongue and heel art, the shoe features a tearaway canvas overlay in high abrasion areas, revealing hits of safety orange when skated.

••REVIEW••

I mean what more can i say about this beautiful replica. Everything seems perfect and pretty close to retail, only con that i have is the swoosh, even on the updated m batch, is still a little too light green, but its not very noticeable.

1l2rijw,I absolutely HATE Adam Silvers direction for the identity of the league,"Off the bat this post has nothing to do with actual basketball so if you’re here for that sorry lol. This is a rant about how bland Adam Silver is making the league

1 - The corporate logos
The Orlando Magic Logo was the tipping point for me today, a team that’s had nothing but hits and now they’re stuck with the same boring basketball in circle with rounded text logo that every other rebrand seems to follow (Jerseys are fire though), Hawks, 76ers, Nuggets, Twolves are other teams who all had much better logos before and now have identical logo silhouettes

2 - The lack of occasion
The Finals and the Playoffs used to actually look like the finals and the playoffs, I don’t even mean bring back the huge Larry logo like in 2008 but just bring back the small logos at least to signify this is in fact a playoff game, the same goes for the jerseys, bring back the nba finals patch, it looks so much better, not to mention YouTube TVs terrible finals logo, just keep the 2010s logo and wack YTTV on it

3 - The atrocious all star weekend
This years all star weekend was abysmal and I hope Adam silver knows it, he keeps trying to do something special and it’s always worse than the standard formula of East vs West with everyone wearing their teams jerseys, I haven’t even seen any clips of the all star game from this year it was that bad. Not to mention the dunk contest needs to be rejuvenated somehow

4 - Corporate redesign of awards
This is minor but a few years ago they redesigned all the end of season awards, they knocked it out the park with the MVP trophy and then just, gave up? The DPOY used to look like a big defensive trophy, now it looks like you won best regional sales manager at your companies awards night. It’s also basically indistinguishable from the 6MOY, MIP and ROY

5 - Nikes Jersey model
This is more about the city jerseys than anything but the Nike jersey model is terrible, to begin every new Nike jersey basically sucked (we seem to be on a correction course now) but especially city jerseys where fans are subjected to a whole year of pushing these jerseys that are ass (especially because they’ve been redesigned every single year so they run out of ideas) all because they need sales up for the jerseys, especially in the playoffs.

6 - The technicals
By god, the technicals. Dudes getting Td up for showing any kind of emotion because silver wants a respectable product, a league built off of guys like Iverson, Jordan, Bird, Shaq who got in their opponents faces, celebrated loudly and now we have ridiculous techs on pretty normal celebrations, it’s like there’s a no taunting rule. AIs step over would’ve had him ejected in this day.

To finish this isn’t a rant that “the NBA was better back in the day” but the vibe of the nba most certainly was, the players, the drama, the legacy building it’s all still here but it’s just starting to look boring, and Adam Silver needs to bring back some of the stuff he took away that has slowly decayed the feel of the league. I’d like to see if others feel the same or if I just have a stick up my ass today.",BJ2435,1748995432.0,2025-06-04 00:03:52,832,0.93,219,NBATalk,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBATalk/comments/1l2rijw/i_absolutely_hate_adam_silvers_direction_for_the/,https://reddit.com/r/NBATalk/comments/1l2rijw/i_absolutely_hate_adam_silvers_direction_for_the/,Nike Dunk,"I absolutely HATE Adam Silvers direction for the identity of the league Off the bat this post has nothing to do with actual basketball so if you’re here for that sorry lol.

1la13k7,Has anyone else tried to use the insoles with the heel Zoom unit from Nike SB shoes like the Dunks or Janoski's as replacements for existing ones?,"I was inspired by seeing people replace the drop in insoles in their Kobe's with ones off Aliexpress with Zoom units. I've been using Game Day Pro's in my PG6's, but I remembered that my Janoski's came with an extra set of insoles. I've only tried them around the house, but they seem slightly narrower and move around. Maybe the ones from the SB Dunks are a little wider?

1kv83tm,Nike SB Dunk Low Power Puff Girls “buttercup” review. S2 batch,"W2C: ‪+86 173 5940 4471‬ (WhatsApp)

Absolutely in love with these bad boys. Comfortable, looks and even feels good.

In the 5th photo u can see just how prominent and BEAUTIFUL the texture is. And considering i paid around 60USD (around 430CNY) shipping included.

As for the box its 1:1, the wrapping paper could be better. It feels like a smooth vinyl type of thickish paper. But i didn’t buy the box i bought the shoes. And so far, definitely worth 60 bucks. 

Shipping took long so if possible ask them for a faster shipping option. 

And im 99% sure that this s2 batch is the best currently.

1l1yih5,"I had some weird guy knocking on my downstairs suite door, but no one was home, he was wearing a black shirt with a white Nike swoosh, and he had an iPad with him, is this person a door to door sales rep?","So basically, I will explain what happened today. I was sitting upstairs at home, and some person was persistently, knocking on the door to the downstairs suite. I am the one that lives in the downstairs suite, but I was upstairs visiting with the person who lives there. I peeked around the house, and this person was taking pictures with a point and shoot camera of the backyard and my power tools as well as the door, and he also had an iPad with him and was texting somebody. He was wearing a black T-shirt with a blue logo or the right side and had a white Nike swoosh logo on the left-hand side. He did not leave a note, nor did he even attempt to knock on the main door of the house at all. I do not know if it was a sales rep or if someone called bylaw to this residence. Has anyone else had a person with similar clothing and a camera and iPad knock on a secondary suite door but not on the main door to the house? I live in Rutland just off of Springfield Road. I’m not sure if there is a campaign going around or if it was someone for a survey. I tried phoning bylaws to see if someone complained, but all I got was their automated system, I also phoned Rutland waterworks to see if it was someone coming to read the meter. I am a little bit concerned as to what this person‘s intentions were as they didn’t try and knock on the main door of the house and they were consistently knocking on the secondary suite door where I reside. I didn’t answer, and he simply walked away. I did not see him go to any other houses on either side.
The person was wearing black dress pants and dress shoes as well. 
Any insight to who this may be would be helpful, as I hope it’s not someone casing the house to steal stuff.

I am the one that lives in the downstairs suite, but I was upstairs visiting with the person who lives there. I peeked around the house, and this person was taking pictures with a point and shoot camera of the backyard and my power tools as well as the door, and he also had an iPad with him and was texting somebody. He was wearing a black T-shirt with a blue logo or the right side and had a white Nike swoosh logo on the left-hand side.

1l9g50k,The Nike Swoosh Effect: Why This Simple Mark Dominates Our World,"Close your eyes for a moment. Picture a logo. Any logo. Chances are, the first image that flashed in your mind was a simple, elegant curve. The [Nike Swoosh](https://weandthecolor.com/how-the-nike-swoosh-logo-became-a-global-icon/203651). It’s a mark so deeply embedded in our culture that it feels less like corporate branding and more like a fundamental symbol, like a plus sign or an arrow. You don’t even need to see the word ""Nike"" to know exactly what it represents.

https://preview.redd.it/2aol36ol5g6f1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0f16d2332c7b0f99a3b0db613b60644027fff99

But have you ever truly considered why? Why does this specific shape hold so much power over our collective imagination? The journey of the **Nike Swoosh** is a fascinating study in design, psychology, and masterful marketing. It’s the story of how a fluid line, born from a tight deadline, became the silent narrator for countless stories of human triumph. Let's deconstruct the elements that make this logo a masterclass in visual communication.

# The Anatomy of a Perfect Mark

Before we get to its history, let's look at the shape itself. The genius of the **Nike Swoosh** is what it communicates without a single word. Its design is a visual vocabulary of positive ideas.

First, there is the undeniable sense of motion. The shape is not static; it’s a verb. It arcs forward, suggesting speed, agility, and a smooth, efficient trajectory. It’s the ""whoosh"" of an athlete sprinting past you, the blur of a ball flying through the air. Your brain processes this movement instantly. This dynamism makes it the perfect emblem for a sportswear company.

But there’s another, more subtle layer at play. What does the shape also resemble? A checkmark. Think about what a checkmark means to you. It signifies correctness, approval, success, and the completion of a task. This positive affirmation is baked directly into the logo's DNA. Every time you see the **Nike Swoosh**, you get a tiny, subconscious dose of ""yes, you can."" It's a visual pat on the back.

# A Student, a Deadline, and a Reluctant ""Yes""

The creation of this global symbol was surprisingly understated. In 1971, Phil Knight, the co-founder of what was then Blue Ribbon Sports, was preparing to launch a new line of shoes. He needed a logo, and he needed it quickly. He turned to a graphic design student at Portland State University, Carolyn Davidson, whom he had met while teaching.

The brief was simple: create a ""stripe"" that looked fast. Davidson spent over 17 hours sketching, exploring concepts that captured the essence of movement. When she presented her options, none of the executives were immediately sold. Knight, looking at the curved checkmark, famously remarked, ""Well, I don't love it, but maybe it will grow on me.""

With production deadlines pressing, they chose the design. Davidson submitted her invoice for $35. It’s one of the most legendary transactions in business history. It proves that a world-changing idea doesn't need a monumental budget, just the right spark of insight.

# Engineering a Global Mindset with the Nike Swoosh

A logo, no matter how well-designed, is only a symbol. It needs a story and a mission to give it life. This is where Nike’s branding strategy transformed the **Nike Swoosh** from a simple mark into a cultural phenomenon.

For years, the logo was paired with the company name. But in 1988, everything changed with three simple words: ""Just Do It."" This campaign, created by the Wieden+Kennedy agency, was a stroke of pure genius. It wasn't about selling shoes; it was about selling a mindset. It was a direct, empowering command to overcome inertia and self-doubt.

""Just Do It"" gave the silent **Nike Swoosh** a powerful voice. The logo was no longer just about the grace of a finished movement; it was about the gritty decision to start. It became a symbol for that internal battle we all face before we run, before we jump, before we try. The Swoosh became the banner under which you fought that battle.

# Achieving Wordless Recognition

By the mid-1990s, Nike's brand identity was so strong that it made an incredibly bold move. It began removing the word ""NIKE"" from its products and advertising, leaving only the standalone Swoosh. This was the ultimate flex in the branding world. It was a confident declaration that their symbol had transcended the need for a name.

Think about what that means. The company trusted that a simple shape could carry the entire weight of its brand, its history, and its ethos. And it worked. The ""nameless"" **Nike Swoosh** became even more powerful. It felt more personal, more universal. It wasn't just a company's logo anymore; it was our symbol for aspiration and action. It had achieved a level of recognition that few brands in history ever will.

# Why the Swoosh Endures and Thrives

So why does the **Nike Swoosh** continue to feel so relevant today? Its endurance comes from a perfect balance of consistency and evolution.

Nike has fiercely protected the logo's core identity. It is always associated with top-tier athletes and moments of peak performance. The Swoosh was on Michael Jordan's shoes as he defied gravity, and on Serena Williams' visor as she dominated the court. The logo absorbs the excellence of those who wear it, continuously recharging its meaning.

At the same time, Nike allows the Swoosh to be a canvas for culture. High-profile collaborations with designers like Virgil Abloh or brands like Tiffany & Co. have seen the logo reinterpreted in countless ways. It can be deconstructed, stitched, or reimagined in new materials, yet its core shape remains instantly recognizable. This adaptability keeps it fresh and exciting for each new generation.

In the end, the **Nike Swoosh** is more than just a logo. It is a compact, visual poem about human potential. It’s a testament to the power of simplicity and the magic that happens when a great design is fused with an even greater story.

It’s the story of how a fluid line, born from a tight deadline, became the silent narrator for countless stories of human triumph. Let's deconstruct the elements that make this logo a masterclass in visual communication.

# The Anatomy of a Perfect Mark

Before we get to its history, let's look at the shape itself. The genius of the **Nike Swoosh** is what it communicates without a single word. Its design is a visual vocabulary of positive ideas.

First, there is the undeniable sense of motion. The shape is not static; it’s a verb. It arcs forward, suggesting speed, agility, and a smooth, efficient trajectory. It’s the ""whoosh"" of an athlete sprinting past you, the blur of a ball flying through the air. Your brain processes this movement instantly. This dynamism makes it the perfect emblem for a sportswear company.

But there’s another, more subtle layer at play. What does the shape also resemble? A checkmark. Think about what a checkmark means to you. It signifies correctness, approval, success, and the completion of a task. This positive affirmation is baked directly into the logo's DNA. Every time you see the **Nike Swoosh**, you get a tiny, subconscious dose of ""yes, you can."" It's a visual pat on the back.

# A Student, a Deadline, and a Reluctant ""Yes""

The creation of this global symbol was surprisingly understated. In 1971, Phil Knight, the co-founder of what was then Blue Ribbon Sports, was preparing to launch a new line of shoes. He needed a logo, and he needed it quickly. He turned to a graphic design student at Portland State University, Carolyn Davidson, whom he had met while teaching.

The brief was simple: create a ""stripe"" that looked fast. Davidson spent over 17 hours sketching, exploring concepts that captured the essence of movement. When she presented her options, none of the executives were immediately sold. Knight, looking at the curved checkmark, famously remarked, ""Well, I don't love it, but maybe it will grow on me.""

With production deadlines pressing, they chose the design. Davidson submitted her invoice for $35. It’s one of the most legendary transactions in business history. It proves that a world-changing idea doesn't need a monumental budget, just the right spark of insight.

# Engineering a Global Mindset with the Nike Swoosh

A logo, no matter how well-designed, is only a symbol. It needs a story and a mission to give it life. This is where Nike’s branding strategy transformed the **Nike Swoosh** from a simple mark into a cultural phenomenon.

For years, the logo was paired with the company name. But in 1988, everything changed with three simple words: ""Just Do It."" This campaign, created by the Wieden+Kennedy agency, was a stroke of pure genius. It wasn't about selling shoes; it was about selling a mindset. It was a direct, empowering command to overcome inertia and self-doubt.

""Just Do It"" gave the silent **Nike Swoosh** a powerful voice. The logo was no longer just about the grace of a finished movement; it was about the gritty decision to start. It became a symbol for that internal battle we all face before we run, before we jump, before we try. The Swoosh became the banner under which you fought that battle.

# Achieving Wordless Recognition

By the mid-1990s, Nike's brand identity was so strong that it made an incredibly bold move. It began removing the word ""NIKE"" from its products and advertising, leaving only the standalone Swoosh. This was the ultimate flex in the branding world. It was a confident declaration that their symbol had transcended the need for a name.

Think about what that means. The company trusted that a simple shape could carry the entire weight of its brand, its history, and its ethos. And it worked. The ""nameless"" **Nike Swoosh** became even more powerful. It felt more personal, more universal. It wasn't just a company's logo anymore; it was our symbol for aspiration and action. It had achieved a level of recognition that few brands in history ever will.

# Why the Swoosh Endures and Thrives

So why does the **Nike Swoosh** continue to feel so relevant today? Its endurance comes from a perfect balance of consistency and evolution.

Nike has fiercely protected the logo's core identity. It is always associated with top-tier athletes and moments of peak performance. The Swoosh was on Michael Jordan's shoes as he defied gravity, and on Serena Williams' visor as she dominated the court. The logo absorbs the excellence of those who wear it, continuously recharging its meaning.

At the same time, Nike allows the Swoosh to be a canvas for culture. High-profile collaborations with designers like Virgil Abloh or brands like Tiffany & Co. have seen the logo reinterpreted in countless ways. It can be deconstructed, stitched, or reimagined in new materials, yet its core shape remains instantly recognizable. This adaptability keeps it fresh and exciting for each new generation.

In the end, the **Nike Swoosh** is more than just a logo. It is a compact, visual poem about human potential. It’s a testament to the power of simplicity and the magic that happens when a great design is fused with an even greater story.

1kxsn05,Swoosh sound when accelerating and RPM hangs,"Hello!

Recently, I've received my MY22 Stelvio 2.0 280. Ride home was a joy without any problems, but 2 days later (today), I've noticed that there is a hissing/swoosh sound when accelerating to 4k rpms and letting go of the gas. Plus, sometimes the car will hang on 2k rpm regardless of speed, pressing breaks does nothing, only gentle gas pushing allows it to go lower (all in normal mode).

The swoosh sound is there even on neutral.

1lbb61k,Asics Superblast 2 or Asics Novablast 5 In 2 Shoe Rotation With Nike Zoomfly 6 For Speed Intervals?,"Hi am currently using Zoomfly 6 for both speed intervals and easy run days (5 km at a pace of 6 min/ km) and am thinking of adding another pair of shoes as an easy or daily trainer.

I initially decided on the Asics Novablast 5 as I liked the bounce of the FF Blast Max foam. They just released some new colorways for the Asics Superblast 2 here and they look better with more premium uppers, albeit at twice the price. I tried the SB 2 on and it felt more stable but with a fuller stack height. There is a bit more of a rocker at the heel. It was also less bouncy in the forefoot / midfoot than the NB 5 which felt a bit squishy. It gave me the impression of being in between the NB 5 and the ZF 6. 

Which would be more appropriate in a rotation with the ZF 6? My other choice was the Adizero SL Evo (which is priced in between the NB 5 and the SB 2 where I am) but it seems that is more for speed.

1l5fip2,I'm disappointed in footwear quality. The quality of $100 sneakers now match quality of $15 shoes from noname brands,"I'm new to this sub, I hope it's appropriate place to discuss it.

TLDR: Adidas/Puma/Nike/etc now makes the same 3-month-use shoes as noname manufacturers sell for $15. What are the other brands that don't suck?

Long post.

My perspective on these things. I'm located in Ukraine. And as you know from memes, we have certain ""adidas culture"" which is partially true. Second\_to\_cheapest shoes, yes, but our market is different: brands made advantage of that and the same Nikes that cost 40 euro in EU will cost over 100 euro in our official Nike stores because fck you that's why. Most other brands don't practice price gouging and mainly the price difference only appears due to reseller store markup or import taxes. Mainly clothes brands do that.

I remember many years ago shoes were lasting for years, not months. Now even when I don't kick football on my way from school, don't climb trees for apples, don't fight with other kids, somehow my shoes degrade faster when I'm just walking in them. Material quality is so inconsistent that last year I bought new winter shoes (Timberland-style leather boots) and somehow in 3 months of winter my soles are worn off and having holes. Leather parts are like new, the stitching and gluing is in perfect condition. Just the rubber of the sole is worn out.

Also I have Puma sneakers and they just detached from soles because apparently normal walking is now considered extreme sport. I bought Adidas to replace them. Less than 6 months and they have a hole in sole that eats small rocks. For years I have old Sketchers sneakers that for some reason didn't fall apart and degraded normally: normal fabric wear, normal sole wear, no holes, no tears. They're old and I use them for dirty work but they still hold like 10+ times longer than 2 times more expensive shoes.

This post is getting too long.

**Ok, what are other casual footwear manufacturers that don't sell hot garbage?** Many brands tend to switch to lower quality materials and technologies in order to squeeze more margins and profits and keep the perceived price the same. So you buy their $10 t-shirt 2 times per year instead of 1 time like many years ago. I think there should be some brands that still keep the quality of their product.

1l0b839,Looking for Recomendations on a new Nike Basketball Shoe?,"Just got my Refund (130 dollar Nike gift card) in for my Nike GT Jump 2s (the sole of the shoes crack around the air pods. Which eventually the pods break themselves) this happens within 6 months for me. I think it's cause I play on my toes.i have done this 3 times and gotten four shoes out of this return system. Unfortunately it feels like the GT Jump Series is dead. 

I have a backup pair of Nike GT Hustle 2s that I absolutely hate (hurt my feet like crazy). I got these from Nike Outlet for chesp to use while deeling with the return process through Nike which takes a few weeks. 

I'm looking for a recommendation for a new shoe. Seeing as I can't just go back to the GT Jump for the 5th time. (God those shoes were great and comfortable as all hell despite their issues with holding up for me)  

I'm 35  6' and hover around 200 lbs. 

The things I loved about the GT Jumps was their Comfort and stability (never once really rolled an ankle in these) 

I also have this weird thing that unfortunately being from Chicago I have refused to wear anything with LeBrons name on it. (Although looking through their current lineup it almost feels like LeBron or Bust) 

I would be thinking about the GT Hustle 3s or the Cuts but my bad experience I have had with the GT Hustle 2s have me concerned cause I really find these shoes nearly unplayable. 

Any suggestions would be great. I got 130 bucks to burn (willing to spend more to make sure I don't end up with the GT Jump 2 scenario) and am looking for suggestions.

I bought a pair of Nike Panda's yesterday, I have not worn them yet.

I was looking online and I noticed the 'style' of Nike Dunks were not the ones I bought or can find anymore..

I see Nike Dunks with a more ""reinforced"" toe look that a bit more ""boxy"" vs what I bought which is like a ""flat"" toe area with no real ""enforcement""  
\-----  
I like the ""reinforced"" look more, where can i find these? Was this design of dunks only from a certain year or type of colors/dunk in general?

I bought a pair of Nike Panda's yesterday, I have not worn them yet.

I was looking online and I noticed the 'style' of Nike Dunks were not the ones I bought or can find anymore..

I see Nike Dunks with a more ""reinforced"" toe look that a bit more ""boxy"" vs what I bought which is like a ""flat"" toe area with no real ""enforcement""  
\-----  
I like the ""reinforced"" look more, where can i find these? Was this design of dunks only from a certain year or type of colors/dunk in general?

  
Sorry new to shoes but ya this style is so off but the names are the same

1lgohs3,This sub makes me smh my head sometimes,"This is a subreddit about sneakers but why is it that designer sneakers get shunned here? I’m being hyperbolic but at least from my perspective it’s somewhat true.

It just makes less sense to me when I see people giving big ups to people paying resell for mass produced Nikes made by someone most likely being underpaid in a country being taken advantage of by corporate big wigs, than when I see designer shoes get no love usually revolving around how much people paid for them or people talking about how they are boring or look like other cheaper shoes (brands like Margiela, Rick Owens, etc.) when these sneakers are usually handmade sneakers in Italy with Italian leather. 

Is there not nuance to the fact that people will pay more for better made products as well as the style of the shoe? I’ll get to the point but I will say that I do recognize that designer sneakers are all overpriced as well. Obviously the reason I posted this is because personally most of my sneakers are Italian made from designer brands. I own Nike’s too but most of my sneakers are from brands like Golden Goose and Margiela, etc. I have never paid full retail for any of them in fact most of them were close to 50% off, which makes most of those purchases only about a $100 difference from Jordan retail prices. (especially pre-covid sales when online boutiques from overseas would have banger sales on designer)

I just feel like there’s some type of discussion to be had about hate towards more expensive products from less-popular brands within sneaker culture, when there’s plenty love towards expensive resold products here.

Is it really just simply because Nikes and Adidas are the mainstream sneaker brands in the world, that not enough people in this subreddit would care for much deviating from the masses of sneaker culture? I feel like there should be implemented a day of the week where this subreddit specifically highlights lesser known brands or designer brands.

1kxaau1,Best Single Shoe Upgrade for 10K Training? Coming from Nike Downshifter 13,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been running casually for a while, but since last year I’ve started training more seriously for 10K races to improve my times. I’m 1.7m tall and weigh 74kg and wear a Nike US size 9. My main sport is weightlifting/powerlifting, and running is a secondary hobby for me.

**Environment:**

* Mid/ Forefoot striker
* Live in tropical SEA, it gets really hot and humid here with lots of rain.
* Open to exploring all types of cushioning

Here's how my typical running load looks:

**Off-season (not training for a race):**  
• 2x/week  
• 1 Long Run (up to 18km)  
• 1 Tempo or Interval Run (within 10km)

**10K training phase:**  
• 3–4x/week  
• 1 Easy Run (<10km)  
• 1 Long Run (up to 14km)  
• 1–2 Tempo/Interval Runs (≤10km)

I currently run in a pair of Nike Downshifter 13s, which I got for cheap at $35, they've accumulated around 300km in distance. I’m looking to upgrade to something better suited for my goals.

**Goal:** Improve my 10K race time. I have no interest in training for half or full marathons anytime soon as it would interfere with my weightlifting progress.

These are the three shoes I’m considering, in order of preference:

1. **Asics Novablast 5** – $145
2. **Nike Zoom Fly 6** – $125
3. **New Balance FuelCell Rebel v4** – $135

If you had to pick **just one** running shoe from the above, which would you choose and why? Love to hear your thoughts, especially if you have a similar background or have used any of these shoes for 10K training.",nwon0002,1748414441.0,2025-05-28 06:40:41,3,1.0,7,AskRunningShoeGeeks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskRunningShoeGeeks/comments/1kxaau1/best_single_shoe_upgrade_for_10k_training_coming/,https://reddit.com/r/AskRunningShoeGeeks/comments/1kxaau1/best_single_shoe_upgrade_for_10k_training_coming/,Nike shoes,"Best Single Shoe Upgrade for 10K Training?

1kw2scn,"Naomi Osaka debuts Sakura Nike kit that she designed for the 2025 French Open. Spring is sakura season ... the girlies are gonna love this one. The light pink Nike piece featured a mock-neck racerback design and a flowy, layered skirt with a rounded hemline. The burgundy contrast trim on the neck and back added a touch of structure to the soft, romantic silhouette. During warm-up, Osaka wore a varsity-style Nike jacket, whose main body is a rich burgundy color with a shiny, glossy finish, while the sleeves are pale pink. The trim on the cuffs, collar, and waistband features white and burgundy stripes, enhancing the sporty varsity look. The shoes are Sakura-themed, which is just in time for spring, which is Sakura season. It follows the flower story that we have throughout the year, said Osaka before the match when speaking with the media. Osaka continued, Im really excited about the kit because I designed it. I dont know why Nike is letting me do this stuff. I say this every Slam. But I think its really adorable. Im just excited. I dont know if you can see from all the way over here, but I did my nails. Theyre Sakura-themed too. Im really sticking to the flower story that we have, concluded Osaka. Her hairstyle featured two puffs on top of her head, each adorned with cherry blossom-like accessories, perfectly tying into her Japanese spring-inspired theme. Osaka revealed a fresh colorway of her signature Nike Zoom GP Challenge 1 tennis shoes. The shoes bloom in a dreamy palette of soft and vibrant pinks, adorned with delicate cherry blossom motifs on the tongue, sides, and even the insoles.",0.006,0.857,0.137,0.988,positive

These are for college events and special occasions. Theyre more comfortable than I expected, though the soles couldve been a bit more cushioned. Other than that, theyre just perfect.

I have over 300 pairs of NikeJordan shoes in my collection and have never resold any of the product. If they were to ask me about any product Ive purchased with my employee discount, its in my collection. There have been rare occasions where I purchase two pairs of a new shoe that hits swoosh for the sense to have one to rock and one to stock for later on. Any shoe I have multiple pairs of as well, I still have. I went out of state about a month ago and went to a different Nike store and purchased three pairs from that store which I still have the pairs. That was the only thing that came to mind using discount in another state but my account has never been flagged or anything. Dont know where the inappropriate use of employee discount comes into play either because Im always buying my size 11-12 depending on the shoe. Rare occasions Ill buy shoes as like a birthday gift, Christmas, etc. with money out of my pocket. Ive paid with my own debit card, credit card, cashapp card when making these purchases. Im well off with the current job I have so I dont have any reason to be reselling either. Has this ever happened to anyone that wasnt reselling or abusing their discount?

The next day, I told him I had gone to the gym and ended up vomiting twice it was a rough session.

How often do you even go to the gym? Then he said something that made my stomach drop Im not comparing, Im just putting you in your place. I dont even know how to describe how that felt. It was condescending, disrespectful, and it felt like he needed to win something at my expense. To make it worse, we had talked about how I love cherries the day before and in the middle of this argument, he goes, You know what? Im not getting you cherries. You dont deserve them.

First The materials is like butter and you can get a tumble leather one this .There is no doubt that the PK factory uses premium quality materials, which makes it difficult for people to tell that it is a rep at first glance. From different angles, the shape of the PK 5.0 and retail one looks slimmer than the market batch , and the market batch looks bulky. Zooming in on the midsole, the pk 5.0 and the retail one appear to be light yellow, while the market version is darker in yellow color. About the back heel ,for market batch The stitching is not even and the fragment logo is far from the top, pk5.0 and the retail one are almost the same. The sole of the market version is darker, the fragment blue of the PK and retail is more pure. Finally, regarding tooling code, we have noticed a lot of customer feedback about font errors last year, which have been fixed in pk 5.0. I believe this version will not disappoint you.

1l6mlzv,"Air Max 1s are the most uncomfortable shoe Ive bought in the last ten years. Visiting my sister in New York City. Forgot my Hoka Clifton 9s, so I ended up only having my Nike Air Max 1s to walk all over the city with. Let me preface this with yes, I know that generally speaking the Air Max 1 these days is more of a fashion shoe than a comfort one. Also, I had a pair of Air Max back in the early aughts that was really comfortable and cushy. But its still a brand new shoe, from one of the biggest companies on earth, and its supposedly got a giant air bag on the heel for comfort while walking. Let me tell you, I just walked probably 5-7 miles, throughout the city, and the balls of my feet are a freaking wreck. I honestly feel like I was wearing dress shoes or no shoes at all. Im absolutely baffled at just how uncomfortable a supposed walkingrunning shoe can be. I know the Air Max tech is old, but I have to believe that Nike can improve the foam and therefore, the ride. They must just not give a shit. This 100 gives me pause on buying anything Nike ever again. Do I have a weird foot? Did I just happen to get a bad pair? Or is this par for the course with the new Nike Air Max?",0.091,0.811,0.098,0.1868,positive

So basically, I will explain what happened today. I was sitting upstairs at home, and some person was persistently, knocking on the door to the downstairs suite. I am the one that lives in the downstairs suite, but I was upstairs visiting with the person who lives there. I peeked around the house, and this person was taking pictures with a point and shoot camera of the backyard and my power tools as well as the door, and he also had an iPad with him and was texting somebody. He was wearing a black T-shirt with a blue logo or the right side and had a white Nike swoosh logo on the left-hand side. He did not leave a note, nor did he even attempt to knock on the main door of the house at all. I do not know if it was a sales rep or if someone called bylaw to this residence. Has anyone else had a person with similar clothing and a camera and iPad knock on a secondary suite door but not on the main door to the house? I live in Rutland just off of Springfield Road. Im not sure if there is a campaign going around or if it was someone for a survey. I tried phoning bylaws to see if someone complained, but all I got was their automated system, I also phoned Rutland waterworks to see if it was someone coming to read the meter. I am a little bit concerned as to what this persons intentions were as they didnt try and knock on the main door of the house and they were consistently knocking on the secondary suite door where I reside. I didnt answer, and he simply walked away. I did not see him go to any other houses on either side. The person was wearing black dress pants and dress shoes as well.

Hi am currently using Zoomfly 6 for both speed intervals and easy run days 5 km at a pace of 6 min km and am thinking of adding another pair of shoes as an easy or daily trainer.

I got these from Nike Outlet for chesp to use while deeling with the return process through Nike which takes a few weeks. Im looking for a recommendation for a new shoe. Seeing as I cant just go back to the GT Jump for the 5th time. God those shoes were great and comfortable as all hell despite their issues with holding up for me Im 35 6 and hover around 200 lbs. The things I loved about the GT Jumps was their Comfort and stability never once really rolled an ankle in these I also have this weird thing that unfortunately being from Chicago I have refused to wear anything with LeBrons name on it. Although looking through their current lineup it almost feels like LeBron or Bust I would be thinking about the GT Hustle 3s or the Cuts but my bad experience I have had with the GT Hustle 2s have me concerned cause I really find these shoes nearly unplayable. Any suggestions would be great. I got 130 bucks to burn willing to spend more to make sure I dont end up with the GT Jump 2 scenario and am looking for suggestions. Thanks in advance.,0.077,0.763,0.159,0.9733,positive
1kv3vsu,"Old Nike Shoes Hi everyone! My sister just brought back a memory I had totally forgotten about. When I was 1112 years old, I had a pair of shoes that I absolutely LOVED. She brought it up because as my older sister she thought they were hideous I got them at a Nike outlet store, so Im assuming they were Nike. They looked more like the shape of converse though? They were black fabric, white soles I think?, and had neon colored doodles all over them. Ive tried finding them online but have been unsuccessful.

1kxi2yw,"AITA for eating ice cream every night just like I always do and not stopping just bc my SIL doesnt want my niece to see it? Most nights after dinner, I eat a small ice cream cone. Its literally the little joy mini cups with a teeny scoop of ice cream. Maybe a big scoop if Im having a rough day but thats kinda rare. I dont drink alcohol or smoke weed or do anything fun so this is my one fun thing I do for myself. My brother and his wife and daughter are staying with me for a few weeks, theyll be gone by June 15. Im happy to have them here. Usually well eat dinner together and go our separate ways for the evening. They watch a lot of TV so theyre usually all in the living room watching. Ive been eating my lil cone, but my sister in law approached me and asked me if I could stop. She said that my niece is starting to ask why she doesnt get to have ice cream and that obviously she was lied to by my sister in law when she told her ice cream is a sometimes food, haha. I said that I wasnt going to stop but I could wait until she was in bed. I figured that was a good compromise and I do get that shes trying to raise her little girl to have a healthy relationship with food. But waiting until she was in bed didnt work because she came into the kitchen multiple times to ask me for some. My SIL was definitely a little incredulous over it and kept saying Really? Do you seriously NEED to eat ice cream every single day? or stuff like it. I said no, but she also doesnt need to drink a glass of wine every day either. She didnt like this and sighed a bunch and has been visibly annoyed with me since then. My brother asked me if I could stop just to avoid the drama, but I said I deserve my little treats. AITA? Hi so Ive decided to log off this post and not come back. This post has just gotten completely out of control with really over the top overreactions and people trying to encourage me to make things worse or escalate and call my sil an alcoholic or to purposely eat more ice cream in front of my niece. Some of you are just like chomping at the bit to call people names and be sarcastic and nasty to me for no reason.

1l04m56,"Costco, Best Buy, Nike, Walmart, Target and Macys among the retailers raising prices as Trump tariffs take hold Consumers who hoped tariffs would not hit their wallets keep getting bad news. As they reported earnings in recent weeks, multiple major retailers said they have already raised some prices or plan to hike them in the coming weeks to offset the duties. They include major grocers and consumer goods sellers Costco, Best Buy, Walmart and Target. President Donald Trumps ever-changing trade policy has roiled retailers as they try to plan their supply chains. On earnings calls, they faced the difficult task of trying to appease investors who want them to protect their bottom lines and shoppers who could balk at price hikes.  In some cases, companies have been explicit, citing the estimated toll tariffs will take on their bottom lines and breaking down which countries their supply chains rely on. Other retailers have been less forthcoming, avoiding the word tariff and instead blaming strategy shifts or price hikes on macroeconomic uncertainty or simply refusing to point the finger at all.  Many retailers have reduced or withdrawn their full-year guidance because of tariffs. Companies such as Abercrombie  Fitch, Macys and Best Buy have slashed their profit outlooks. Meanwhile, American Eagle, Canada Goose, Ross and Mattel pulled their full-year guidance.  Economists on both sides of the aisle agree that tariffs are inflationary and the cost will likely be passed on to consumers, though government data has not showed a clear effect yet. A majority, 68, of U.S. CEOs say they have either increased prices already or are considering doing so this year in the face of tariffs, according to a new survey by Chief Executive Group and AlixPartners.

Lets get into it  This is for informational purposes only. You are entitled to your own opinion of the details I discuss. This review is my opinion of this pair. First off... Shoutout TMF! What can I say TMF is awesome. TMF was patient and responsive and helped RL with ease when I needed to... This pair only took 9 days from the GL to my door! WhatsApp and W2C Link below my review. Appearance Straight out of the box, these are clean. The all-white colorway hits hard with the subtle silver accents. Its got that icy, premium looksuper wearable and lowkey but still stands out. The silhouette looks accurate and well-shaped toe box height is solid. I am pleased with the appearance . In Hand Feel The shoe feels sturdy but not overly stiff. Decent weight in hand and does not feel cheap IMO. The padding around the ankle is plush, and the tongue has a good padding to it also. The leather is soft but firm. Feels like quality IMO. Stitching Stitching is tidy and consistent throughout. No crazy flaws or loose threads, but the exterior of the right shoes toe elephant prints double stitching is slightly too spaced. No one will notice this on foot. The double stitch pattern around the midsole and upper panels is clean and uniform though. Upper Material The upper is a smooth tumbled leather, and it feels soft to the touchfeels above average and good quality. Doesnt feel plasticky, and it has that nice grainy texture in the right lighting. Elephant Print The elephant print is good but could be a bit more consistent. Its a light off white grayish with white cracks. The scale pattern looks close to what I would anticipate from retailjust the right amount of contrast, but its too early to say definitely how retail will be. Placement around the toe is ever slightly inconsistent but no one will notice this on foot. The heel is consistent. This is fine . Heel Tab Jumpman logo and AIR text on the heel tab are centered and crisp. No leaning or misalignment. Heel tab material feels sturdy but flexible. Bounces back well when pulled down to show the Pure stitching. Sole Outsole is white with grey JORDAN lettering that pops out and is aligned correctly. The traction pattern looks on point. The insole is white with a grey jumpman. Conclusion Overall, this pair is a WIN from RN. I was surprised by the quality in hand. For the most part, the shape, materials, and build quality all check out. This pair will release in 2025, so still a bit early to say how the official release will look next month, but you can wear these with confidence. I feel like this is a super solid cop. RN delivered!

1kytbxq,"Had a fashion epiphany after visiting Japan Man, US fashion absolutely sucks after seeing what they wear. 99 of the outfits are perfectly catered to a specific niche. Even the most basic blank t-shirt and pants combos are just so well done. A perfect fitting blank t-shirt, just the right amount of baggy slacks, super cool belt, and a nice pair of loafers, boots, business shoes, etc. The layering and crops are also always spot-on. I seriously cannot describe it. It is something you really just need to walk around and see. They really put so much effort into their outfits and leave nothing out. Youd probably be executed for wearing a Nike t-shirt, jeans, and running shoes like 90 of the US guys.

I dont think hes going to be shy about saying what he seesat all, Smith concluded. Stephen A. Smith doesnt think Michael Jordan will hold back his true thoughts on TV. At upfronts last month, NBC announced that Jordan would be a special contributor when it resumes its NBA coverage later this year. Basketball fans have been cautiously optimistic that we will get the version of Jordan from the Last Dance documentary, where he chomped cigars and was ruthless about rivals and critics, as opposed to a politician hesitant to offend his constituents. Smith appeared on Patrick Bet-Davids PBD Podcast last week and made it sound like Jordan, whom he talks to with some regularity, is ready to speak with candor. Let me tell you something about Michael Jordan Hes going to be brutally honestI can assure you that, Smith said. Hes not going to be somebody whos going to be passive. ... The Michael Jordan I know, when talking basketball, he is as candid as it gets. He aint trying to hurt nobodys feelings. He aint trying to be insultingbut hes going to tell you whats going on. I dont think hes going to be passive at all. I really, really dont, and Im actually proud of him for doing it because, with the Jordan brand and him being worth over 2 billion, he dont need this, Smith continued. Smith said he urged Jordan to take on more public commentary, telling him to stop acting like you have nothing to say about basketball now that youre retiredyou talk about it all the damn time! Smith added Jordan will call him to disagree with things he said on-air, and while hes not as aggressive about it as Kobe Bryant used to be, hes candid. I dont think hes going to be shy about saying what he seesat all, Smith concluded. As a matter of fact, if he is, hes going to have to deal with me because Im going to be in his ear telling him, Youre getting shy now. Thats what were doing? That aint the MJ I know! Elsewhere in the segment, Bet-David referenced internet rumors that NBC is paying Jordan 40 million annually. A source tells Front Office Sports that this number, which is about twice what Charles Barkley makes per year from TNT, is inaccurate. NBC declined to comment.

Here are some less known photos from the IDFs collection in their website. Following Egypts declaration of war by blocking naval routes, calling up UN peacekeepers to leave, and the making of genocidal threats, together with Syria encouraging terrorists, and threatening to cut the Jordan rivers water source, Israel has decided to launch a surprise attack instead of waiting for its enemies to strike on their terms. Israeli air force managed to surprise the Egyptian, Syrians, Jordanians and Iraqis, crippling their capabilities, and getting a huge advantage in a risky gambit. Following the victory, Israel has expanded its territory by multiple sizes. It got ahold on the Golan Heights, where Syrians have been using the high ground to indiscriminately bomb Israeli civilians for years During Cease fires. It united Jerusalem, got control over the West Bank, and of course the entire Sinai. Israel wanted to negotiate for peace and recognition, but the Arabs Including the Arabs of Palestine met for the Khartoum Resolution, which included No peace with Israel, No negotiation with Israel, No recognition of Israel. Despite this, Jordan eventually gave up on their claims to the West Bank, stripping many Palestinians from their citizenship Israel ended up offering the majority of it for the Arabs living there on multiple occasions, but all offers were rejected so far and making peace. Egypt also gave up on their eternal war, and eventually agreed to recognize Israel and have peace with it in return of the Sinai Minus Gaza which they did not want back. And pretty much only Syria refused up to this day, despite offers continuing up to the 90s. And at this point today, the Golan Heights have been Israeli over 3 times the time they were Syrian. To sum it up, this war has greatly shaped the area, and its consequences effect us all here to this day. Photo source",0.141,0.767,0.092,-0.9291,negative

I will say , Y3 has performed very well!! They are extremely comfortable, and probably one of my newest favorite pair of sneakers! I am so happy with this purchase from Shoe Tim! Lets get into it... Materials. The leather quality on these is fantastic, premium, and soft, but does not crease. Tongue- great material, feels good Side cage- very good , feels premium Leather- very soft , doesnt crease Lace lock- Heavy duty, same as retail Comfort These are the most comfortable pair of Jordan Retro 5s I have ever put on my feet, can wear all day without any issues , or feet hurting! Sizing These are TTS , fit my feet very well! Details I havent had a Retail pair in hands, but they look very good! Side cage- placed well , like retail Tongue- Jordan sign is good, Thick tongue , Color- Colors look good, same as retail Shape- Over all shape looks good , close to retail OVERALL I will rate this pair a 9.5 10 , and the only reason they arent getting a 10, is because I havent had a retail pair to compare them to, I will say I havent LJR Jordan 5s, and the Y3 feels much better on my feet, the quality is just crazy good! If you have questioned yourself on whether or not Y3 is a good choice, I 100 will buy more Y3 version Jordan Retro 5s...

1l75nly,"Just do it. Just wanted to come on here and share a huge win for me. I have had insomnia for over 5 years. Sometimes not sleeping for 4-5 days at a time, only being able to sleep in my own bed not go on vacations or trips with my friends, living in complete and total fear of sleep deprivation to the point where it controlled every aspect of my life. My insomnia is due to anxiety fear of sleep loss the fear of spending 1,2,3,4,5, days without sleep makes me so scared that I cant sleep, so this piece of advice may not be super applicable to those who experience medical insomnia. Anyways I have avoided going on trips, vacations, sleeping over at anyones house, and going out in general because I was scared to spend the next day sleepless. I booked a trip with my friends, and spent the following 4 months terrified, dreading this trip. At the last minute, I decided I cant do it. I wont sleep at all. I will have an awful time. My friends will have to take me back home and I will ruin it for everyone., so I stayed behind while they left. As I was sitting in my apartment, I heard a voice say just do it. GO. You are 23 years old. You cant let this take away your fun, your memories, your life. Even if you dont sleep for 4 days you wont die, at least you can say you tried. You cant keep isolating yourself like this. So I stopped what I was doing, got up and started packing. With all the motivation in me to live my life, and all the fear that this disorder would kill me, I drove all the way there myself. I did not sleep the first night, but I had an amazing day even without sleep. I was able to do everything that my friends did, and even had time to take a cat nap. You wouldnt believe what pushing myself as hard as I could did for me I slept. I SLEPT ON THE TRIP!!! I expanded my capacity to go beyond what I thought I could do. I tired myself out by having such a good time in a different state, seeing things that I have never seen before. I made sure to have my own private room so that I could have my space to feel anxiety and do the things that made me feel comforted in my own home. It was not 8 hours of deep sleep, more like 4 hours, but thats normal for trips! I slept the third night even BETTER than the second too. I am so proud of myself, and I am ready to keep facing the fear of not sleeping and leaving my comfort zone. So here is my advice to those of you who experience sleep anxiety JUST DO IT. GO ON THAT TRIP. A FEW DAYS WITHOUT SLEEP WONT KILL YOU! EXPOSURE THERAPY REALLY COULD WORK!!",0.104,0.782,0.114,0.9182,positive

1lgtxrl,"Our daughter said that my partner 28F is her mother, and I 27F am not. My partner said she just told her the truth, and it doesnt matter, but why would she say something like this, and how do I deal with it? My partner and I have been together for nine years. It isnt legally recognised to be married where we live, but we would be if we could. I know some people would assume we have commitment issues or something like that, but thats the way it is. We have two daughters. One is four, and the other is six months old. Biologically, they are completely hers. Other than the donor. We do not know their identity, but our children can request it as adults. We had it done in a neighbouring country, because they are hesitant about doing it for people in our situation here. I love children, but I didnt want to be pregnant, and its a very long process. She did want to, so it worked out well. I am in the post graduate stage at the moment of being a doctor. Its what Ive always wanted, and its important to me that we are in the position where our children can do whatever they want in the future as well. I also really enjoy it, its interesting, and while its a lot of work, its worth it to me. I do try to help and spend as much time with the children as I can. It can be hard though because of the hours I have to work. Some of my colleagues are more understanding, I am lucky to work in quite a modern place, so I do get better hours most of the time, but it still isnt ideal. I try to at least help either every morning or evening, I bath them, I dress them, I read to them, I play with them, I take them places, I really do try to be as present as possible. I dont want to be the parent whos always working. I also try to help my partner obviously, I clean, I cook meals, I do those sorts of things as well. About a week ago, I was putting our older daughter to bed. She said, why is my partner I will use that because she calls us both different names, which is both personal and it would get confusing with you, and not my father. I said that we have talked about this. And she said yes, and my partner had said to her Im not her mother, and she is. And that she doesnt understand why my partner was weird and was with me and not her father. Obviously, children can get confused. So I talked to my partner and asked why our daughter said this, and why she thought this. We have discussed with her before when she has asked how it works, why she has two mothers, and it never involved who was the real mother. She knows my partner gave birth to her, shes seen photos of her pregnant and things like that, but shes little, she doesnt really understand what that means. My partner said she had just told her the truth when she had asked, and I asked why. She said that we cant lie and act like were the same because were not, and its only going to confuse her. I said that shes not confused, that her father is irrelevant in this because hes not her father, and all she did was centre everything around her and act like I dont matter. She said Im making it into something significant when its not, and that she did far more than I have ever done, and that neither of our children would be here without her. And thats true. But it feels like she doesnt care about everything I have done, and the worst thing for me is that she would tell our child these sorts of things. It really upsets me that now, she might see as different, and thats all because of what she said to her. I dont know why she suddenly thinks so differently to me, when we never had this before. Maybe theres something I cant see, maybe something is wrong, I dont know, but I didnt think there was. Im just confused. Its not like her.",0.063,0.819,0.118,0.994,positive

1lf0wh2,"Do I 27f just accept that my fiance 35m can only pay a small portion of the bills and not question it? TLDR My fiance gets angry when i talk about money, currently we need to move to a bigger place for his daughter and he refuses to pay 5050. Do I just accept that he can only pay a small portion of the bills and not question it despite his good income? For context My fiance and I have lived together for five months now. Currently I pay a majority of the bills about 7030. Which I agreed to as this was my apartment first and was supposed to be temporary until we found a bigger place. The plan was to split bills 5050 when we moved. We are at a point now that we really need a bigger place. He has a daughter we have on the weekends and currently she is sleeping in the living room. When I asked him how much he can afford in rent he told me 600 a month TOTAL for his half of rentelectricityWi-Fi. He makes 65k annually usd, and has minimal other bills. Also prior to moving in with me, he paid 1100 a month in rent alone. So Im not sure why now he can only afford 600. A few times now, I have asked him to sit down with me and create a budget. As he makes enough money to pay more than 600 a month in bills. And quite frankly that wont even cover half the rent for a 2 bedroom apartment in my city much less the added costs of utilities and WiFi. Every time this happens, he gets angry, yells at me accusing me of being judgmental when it comes to money and storms off. When truly all I care about is making sure that we get a bigger place with a room for his daughter. He refuses to make a budget and says that its unnecessary and that hes a grown man who has never had to have one. At this point, I believe he just expects me to shoulder paying more in bills and I feel a little used. I do make more money but not by much 75k usd. Im just not sure what to do at this point do I just accept the amount he gave me and not question it? However, that puts me in a situation where Im paying a majority of the bills, which I dont feel is fair.",0.06,0.905,0.035,-0.579,negative

1l8q97a,"Perhaps a sacrilegious opinion, but I think it is weird that Obsidian just refuses to do player character romance no matter what and it does downgrade their games for ME at least a bit. Legitimately, I do not understand it. They can clearly write romance as indicated by lots of people liking Parvatis romance quest. But they will NOT do it for players at all cost if they can help it. The biggest reason I have ever been given is they dont feel the can deliver a good quality romance and thus decide not to do it it when I cant help but point out that them not being perfect has never prevented them from including lots of other mechanics. I play their games often in SPITE of their numerous weird if not outright bad gameplay mechanics. But for some reason they can include those no matter how haphazardly they cobbled them together, but romance? Nah that they wont do cause they cant make it good enough apparently? Which, gonna be real, they are never gonna get better or improve in their romance writing if they just never tackle it. Straight up, I want romances in my RPGs games okay? In particular if you make companions a big deal, as they tend to do, it feels outright strange to me how adamantly they refuse to just let us romance them no matter what. I know I am not alone in this. People LOVE themselves an RPG romance. But for some reason every time people point out Obsidian refuses to do them it goes oh, that is just how they are as if this is some minor quirk. Which, fair enough if it is for you, but I loved a LOT of RPGs for their romances. I would have still probably enjoyed Blauds Gate 3 without the several amazing romance options, but significantly less so. And to some degree I gotta think if the reasoning REALLY is this I dont wanna under deliver mindset in regard to it, I cant help but think that not doing it AT ALL is not much of an improvement. Especially since again, they in my mind HAVE shown they can do romance, but just refuse to let players be the one who participate in them rather than just the companions and NPCs.",0.086,0.658,0.256,0.9982,positive

1lcgz9e,"Why do people keep dismissing this game by saying its just a copy of Poppy Playtime ? Seriously, I want to understand that criticism because the only thing I see that are similar are  1. You walk around in an abandoned area 2. You get chased by ennemies 3. Its a free roam 3d game 4. There are cardboard cutouts which make noises 5. There are puzzles for you to solve But when you actually look at the differences, you can see that  1. This game emphasises exploration by letting you explore a building and even backtrack to certain areas with a realistic layout and shortcuts that can even lead you to optional secret areas, instead of going from just point A to point B. 2. The stealth sections are a lot more creative with them having only one enemy that can appear in any costume, blending well with the different areas. They also vary in how you have to progress through them in the game, for example by either gathering missing pieces or animatronic parts. 3. The gameplay also varies with different and creative chase sequences like with Big top and Dollie. 4. You have collectables which lets you achieve a secret ending with an unique inventory system. 5. The puzzles are still very different and unique from the ones in Poppy playtime. 5. Theres still supernatural elements in this game, like with the Tiger rock costume seemingly being haunted chasing you in the basement section. 6. There are multiple endings. TLDR, even if there are some similarities, SOTM still has a TON of different elements that makes it unique and great in its execution than other mascot horror games.",0.075,0.799,0.125,0.938,positive

1l2rijw,"I absolutely HATE Adam Silvers direction for the identity of the league Off the bat this post has nothing to do with actual basketball so if youre here for that sorry lol. This is a rant about how bland Adam Silver is making the league 1 - The corporate logos The Orlando Magic Logo was the tipping point for me today, a team thats had nothing but hits and now theyre stuck with the same boring basketball in circle with rounded text logo that every other rebrand seems to follow Jerseys are fire though, Hawks, 76ers, Nuggets, Twolves are other teams who all had much better logos before and now have identical logo silhouettes 2 - The lack of occasion The Finals and the Playoffs used to actually look like the finals and the playoffs, I dont even mean bring back the huge Larry logo like in 2008 but just bring back the small logos at least to signify this is in fact a playoff game, the same goes for the jerseys, bring back the nba finals patch, it looks so much better, not to mention YouTube TVs terrible finals logo, just keep the 2010s logo and wack YTTV on it 3 - The atrocious all star weekend This years all star weekend was abysmal and I hope Adam silver knows it, he keeps trying to do something special and its always worse than the standard formula of East vs West with everyone wearing their teams jerseys, I havent even seen any clips of the all star game from this year it was that bad. Not to mention the dunk contest needs to be rejuvenated somehow 4 - Corporate redesign of awards This is minor but a few years ago they redesigned all the end of season awards, they knocked it out the park with the MVP trophy and then just, gave up? The DPOY used to look like a big defensive trophy, now it looks like you won best regional sales manager at your companies awards night. Its also basically indistinguishable from the 6MOY, MIP and ROY 5 - Nikes Jersey model This is more about the city jerseys than anything but the Nike jersey model is terrible, to begin every new Nike jersey basically sucked we seem to be on a correction course now but especially city jerseys where fans are subjected to a whole year of pushing these jerseys that are ass especially because theyve been redesigned every single year so they run out of ideas all because they need sales up for the jerseys, especially in the playoffs. 6 - The technicals By god, the technicals. Dudes getting Td up for showing any kind of emotion because silver wants a respectable product, a league built off of guys like Iverson, Jordan, Bird, Shaq who got in their opponents faces, celebrated loudly and now we have ridiculous techs on pretty normal celebrations, its like theres a no taunting rule. AIs step over wouldve had him ejected in this day. To finish this isnt a rant that the NBA was better back in the day but the vibe of the nba most certainly was, the players, the drama, the legacy building its all still here but its just starting to look boring, and Adam Silver needs to bring back some of the stuff he took away that has slowly decayed the feel of the league. Id like to see if others feel the same or if I just have a stick up my ass today.",0.095,0.77,0.135,0.9827,positive

1l9g50k,"The Nike Swoosh Effect Why This Simple Mark Dominates Our World Close your eyes for a moment. Picture a logo. Any logo. Chances are, the first image that flashed in your mind was a simple, elegant curve. The Nike Swoosh Its a mark so deeply embedded in our culture that it feels less like corporate branding and more like a fundamental symbol, like a plus sign or an arrow. You dont even need to see the word Nike to know exactly what it represents. But have you ever truly considered why? Why does this specific shape hold so much power over our collective imagination? The journey of the Nike Swoosh is a fascinating study in design, psychology, and masterful marketing. Its the story of how a fluid line, born from a tight deadline, became the silent narrator for countless stories of human triumph. Lets deconstruct the elements that make this logo a masterclass in visual communication.  The Anatomy of a Perfect Mark Before we get to its history, lets look at the shape itself. The genius of the Nike Swoosh is what it communicates without a single word. Its design is a visual vocabulary of positive ideas. First, there is the undeniable sense of motion. The shape is not static its a verb. It arcs forward, suggesting speed, agility, and a smooth, efficient trajectory. Its the whoosh of an athlete sprinting past you, the blur of a ball flying through the air. Your brain processes this movement instantly. This dynamism makes it the perfect emblem for a sportswear company. But theres another, more subtle layer at play. What does the shape also resemble? A checkmark. Think about what a checkmark means to you. It signifies correctness, approval, success, and the completion of a task. This positive affirmation is baked directly into the logos DNA. Every time you see the Nike Swoosh, you get a tiny, subconscious dose of yes, you can. Its a visual pat on the back.  A Student, a Deadline, and a Reluctant Yes The creation of this global symbol was surprisingly understated. In 1971, Phil Knight, the co-founder of what was then Blue Ribbon Sports, was preparing to launch a new line of shoes. He needed a logo, and he needed it quickly. He turned to a graphic design student at Portland State University, Carolyn Davidson, whom he had met while teaching. The brief was simple create a stripe that looked fast. Davidson spent over 17 hours sketching, exploring concepts that captured the essence of movement. When she presented her options, none of the executives were immediately sold. Knight, looking at the curved checkmark, famously remarked, Well, I dont love it, but maybe it will grow on me. With production deadlines pressing, they chose the design. Davidson submitted her invoice for 35. Its one of the most legendary transactions in business history. It proves that a world-changing idea doesnt need a monumental budget, just the right spark of insight.  Engineering a Global Mindset with the Nike Swoosh A logo, no matter how well-designed, is only a symbol. It needs a story and a mission to give it life. This is where Nikes branding strategy transformed the Nike Swoosh from a simple mark into a cultural phenomenon. For years, the logo was paired with the company name. But in 1988, everything changed with three simple words Just Do It. This campaign, created by the WiedenKennedy agency, was a stroke of pure genius. It wasnt about selling shoes it was about selling a mindset. It was a direct, empowering command to overcome inertia and self-doubt. Just Do It gave the silent Nike Swoosh a powerful voice. The logo was no longer just about the grace of a finished movement it was about the gritty decision to start. It became a symbol for that internal battle we all face before we run, before we jump, before we try. The Swoosh became the banner under which you fought that battle.  Achieving Wordless Recognition By the mid-1990s, Nikes brand identity was so strong that it made an incredibly bold move. It began removing the word NIKE from its products and advertising, leaving only the standalone Swoosh. This was the ultimate flex in the branding world. It was a confident declaration that their symbol had transcended the need for a name. Think about what that means. The company trusted that a simple shape could carry the entire weight of its brand, its history, and its ethos. And it worked. The nameless Nike Swoosh became even more powerful. It felt more personal, more universal. It wasnt just a companys logo anymore it was our symbol for aspiration and action. It had achieved a level of recognition that few brands in history ever will.  Why the Swoosh Endures and Thrives So why does the Nike Swoosh continue to feel so relevant today? Its endurance comes from a perfect balance of consistency and evolution. Nike has fiercely protected the logos core identity. It is always associated with top-tier athletes and moments of peak performance. The Swoosh was on Michael Jordans shoes as he defied gravity, and on Serena Williams visor as she dominated the court. The logo absorbs the excellence of those who wear it, continuously recharging its meaning. At the same time, Nike allows the Swoosh to be a canvas for culture. High-profile collaborations with designers like Virgil Abloh or brands like Tiffany  Co. have seen the logo reinterpreted in countless ways. It can be deconstructed, stitched, or reimagined in new materials, yet its core shape remains instantly recognizable. This adaptability keeps it fresh and exciting for each new generation. In the end, the Nike Swoosh is more than just a logo. It is a compact, visual poem about human potential. Its a testament to the power of simplicity and the magic that happens when a great design is fused with an even greater story.

1l5fip2,"Im disappointed in footwear quality. The quality of 100 sneakers now match quality of 15 shoes from noname brands Im new to this sub, I hope its appropriate place to discuss it. TLDR AdidasPumaNikeetc now makes the same 3-month-use shoes as noname manufacturers sell for 15. What are the other brands that dont suck? Long post. My perspective on these things. Im located in Ukraine. And as you know from memes, we have certain adidas culture which is partially true. Secondtocheapest shoes, yes, but our market is different brands made advantage of that and the same Nikes that cost 40 euro in EU will cost over 100 euro in our official Nike stores because fck you thats why. Most other brands dont practice price gouging and mainly the price difference only appears due to reseller store markup or import taxes. Mainly clothes brands do that. I remember many years ago shoes were lasting for years, not months. Now even when I dont kick football on my way from school, dont climb trees for apples, dont fight with other kids, somehow my shoes degrade faster when Im just walking in them. Material quality is so inconsistent that last year I bought new winter shoes Timberland-style leather boots and somehow in 3 months of winter my soles are worn off and having holes. Leather parts are like new, the stitching and gluing is in perfect condition. Just the rubber of the sole is worn out. Also I have Puma sneakers and they just detached from soles because apparently normal walking is now considered extreme sport. I bought Adidas to replace them. Less than 6 months and they have a hole in sole that eats small rocks. For years I have old Sketchers sneakers that for some reason didnt fall apart and degraded normally normal fabric wear, normal sole wear, no holes, no tears. Theyre old and I use them for dirty work but they still hold like 10 times longer than 2 times more expensive shoes. This post is getting too long. Ok, what are other casual footwear manufacturers that dont sell hot garbage? Many brands tend to switch to lower quality materials and technologies in order to squeeze more margins and profits and keep the perceived price the same. So you buy their 10 t-shirt 2 times per year instead of 1 time like many years ago. I think there should be some brands that still keep the quality of their product. Maybe you have some good experience with some products?",0.07,0.836,0.094,0.8783,positive

1lgohs3,"This sub makes me smh my head sometimes This is a subreddit about sneakers but why is it that designer sneakers get shunned here? Im being hyperbolic but at least from my perspective its somewhat true. It just makes less sense to me when I see people giving big ups to people paying resell for mass produced Nikes made by someone most likely being underpaid in a country being taken advantage of by corporate big wigs, than when I see designer shoes get no love usually revolving around how much people paid for them or people talking about how they are boring or look like other cheaper shoes brands like Margiela, Rick Owens, etc. when these sneakers are usually handmade sneakers in Italy with Italian leather. Is there not nuance to the fact that people will pay more for better made products as well as the style of the shoe? Ill get to the point but I will say that I do recognize that designer sneakers are all overpriced as well. Obviously the reason I posted this is because personally most of my sneakers are Italian made from designer brands. I own Nikes too but most of my sneakers are from brands like Golden Goose and Margiela, etc. I have never paid full retail for any of them in fact most of them were close to 50 off, which makes most of those purchases only about a 100 difference from Jordan retail prices. especially pre-covid sales when online boutiques from overseas would have banger sales on designer I just feel like theres some type of discussion to be had about hate towards more expensive products from less-popular brands within sneaker culture, when theres plenty love towards expensive resold products here. Is it really just simply because Nikes and Adidas are the mainstream sneaker brands in the world, that not enough people in this subreddit would care for much deviating from the masses of sneaker culture? I feel like there should be implemented a day of the week where this subreddit specifically highlights lesser known brands or designer brands. What do yall think?",0.046,0.822,0.133,0.9889,positive

    "selftext": "I'm 20M, and I've never owned a pair of Nike shoes. Since January, I’d been saving up to buy the Nike Dunk Lows, and I managed to save around 5k (coming from a middle-class background). But all the Dunks I liked were priced above 8-9k. So, I gave up on the idea for now and decided to buy three different shoes for different occasions instead.\n\n1st Pair - Urban Blaze: Phantom:\nGot these from The Souled Store and I absolutely love the color. These are for college events and special occasions. They're more comfortable than I expected, though the soles could’ve been a bit more cushioned. Other than that, they’re just perfect.\nPrice: ₹2,500\n\n2nd Pair - Puma ST Runner V4 L (Leather):\nGot these from Flipkart for daily college use. They're very comfortable and fit really well. Very soft and cushioned soles and looks slick.\nPrice: ₹1,700\n\n3rd Pair - Campus Men's Hurricane Running Shoes:\nI bought these for the gym and evening walks. They look decent, are quite comfortable, and super lightweight. Perfect for the gym, I'd say.\nPrice: ₹700\n\nSo I spent a total of Rs. 4900 and saved 100 rupees.🥹\n\nP.S. I'm not giving up on my dream of owning Nike Dunk Lows. I’ll buy them as soon as I land a job. 🥲👍🏻",

    "full_text": "Got 3 Shoes instead of 1 Nike I'm 20M, and I've never owned a pair of Nike shoes. Since January, I’d been saving up to buy the Nike Dunk Lows, and I managed to save around 5k (coming from a middle-class background). But all the Dunks I liked were priced above 8-9k. So, I gave up on the idea for now and decided to buy three different shoes for different occasions instead.\n\n1st Pair - Urban Blaze: Phantom:\nGot these from The Souled Store and I absolutely love the color. These are for college events and special occasions. They're more comfortable than I expected, though the soles could’ve been a bit more cushioned. Other than that, they’re just perfect.\nPrice: ₹2,500\n\n2nd Pair - Puma ST Runner V4 L (Leather):\nGot these from Flipkart for daily college use. They're very comfortable and fit really well. Very soft and cushioned soles and looks slick.\nPrice: ₹1,700\n\n3rd Pair - Campus Men's Hurricane Running Shoes:\nI bought these for the gym and evening walks. They look decent, are quite comfortable, and super lightweight. Perfect for the gym, I'd say.\nPrice: ₹700\n\nSo I spent a total of Rs. 4900 and saved 100 rupees.🥹\n\nP.S. I'm not giving up on my dream of owning Nike Dunk Lows. I’ll buy them as soon as I land a job. 🥲👍🏻"

I have a habit of wearing new stuff before washing to test the quality. 1 wear palang (without washing) and the socks are already frizzy. the threads thin and it'll probably get loose in 3 months tops. mas ok pa ata yung mga binebenta sa baclaran. heck mas ok pa yung ibang brands na nasuot ko (burlington, iconic, fila)\n\nif anyone here has sock recommendations, it will be greatly appreciated!"

    "selftext": "Back again with another in-hand review and this time it’s the **Air Jordan 3 “Pure Money” 2025 (RN Batch)!** Let’s get into it 🔍\n\n\n\n* This is for informational purposes only. You are entitled to your own opinion of the details I discuss. This review is my opinion of this pair.*\n\n\nFirst off… **Shoutout TMF!** What can I say TMF is awesome.  TMF was patient and responsive and helped RL with ease when I needed to… This pair only took 9 days from the GL✅  🔼 ✈️  to my door!  **WhatsApp and W2C Link below my review.** \n\n\n\n⸻\n\n👀 **Appearance:**\nStraight out of the box, these are *clean.* The all-white colorway hits hard with the subtle silver accents. It’s got that icy, premium look—super wearable and lowkey but still stands out. The silhouette looks accurate and well-shaped; toe box height is solid. I am pleased with the appearance 😍.\n\n⸻\n\n🖐️ **In Hand Feel:**\nThe shoe feels sturdy but not overly stiff. Decent weight in hand and does not feel “cheap” IMO. The padding around the ankle is plush, and the tongue has a good padding to it also. The leather is soft but firm. Feels like quality IMO.\n\n⸻\n\n🧵 **Stitching:**\nStitching is tidy and consistent throughout. No crazy flaws or loose threads, but the exterior of the right shoe’s toe elephant print’s double stitching is slightly too spaced. No one will notice this on foot. The double stitch pattern around the midsole and upper panels is clean and uniform though.\n\n⸻\n\n🔝 **Upper Material:**\nThe upper is a smooth tumbled leather, and it feels soft to the touch—feels above average and good quality. Doesn’t feel plasticky, and it has that nice grainy texture in the right lighting. \n\n⸻\n\n🐘 **Elephant Print:**\nThe elephant print is good but could be a bit more consistent. It’s a light off white grayish with white cracks. The scale pattern looks close to what I would anticipate from retail—just the right amount of contrast, but it’s too early to say definitely how retail will be. Placement around the toe is ever slightly inconsistent but no one will notice this on foot. The heel is consistent. This is fine 👍.\n\n⸻\n\n👟 **Heel Tab:**\nJumpman logo and “AIR” text on the heel tab are centered and crisp. No leaning or misalignment. Heel tab material feels sturdy but flexible. Bounces back well when pulled down to show the “Pure$” stitching. \n\n⸻\n\n🦶 **Sole:**\nOutsole is white with grey “JORDAN” lettering that pops out and is aligned correctly.  The traction pattern looks on point. The insole is white with a grey jumpman.\n\n⸻\n\n✅ **Conclusion:**\nOverall, this pair is a WIN from **RN.** I was surprised by the quality in hand. For the most part, the shape, materials, and build quality all check out.  This pair will release in 2025, so still a bit early to say how the official release will look next month, but you can wear these with confidence. I feel like this is a super solid cop. **RN delivered!** 🔥\n\n⸻\n\n**W2C:** TMF\n\n**Shipping:** 9 days to US\n\n**Price:** 390¥ + Shipping (if direct)\n\n**WhatsApp:** +8613735428664\n\nhttps://shop1809267573.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7336372745&wfr=BuyercopyURL&share_relation=26ba14118b469af2_1426155685_1&spider_token=95ef",

TMF was patient and responsive and helped RL with ease when I needed to… This pair only took 9 days from the GL✅  🔼 ✈️  to my door!  **WhatsApp and W2C Link below my review.** \n\n\n\n⸻\n\n👀 **Appearance:**\nStraight out of the box, these are *clean.* The all-white colorway hits hard with the subtle silver accents. It’s got that icy, premium look—super wearable and lowkey but still stands out. The silhouette looks accurate and well-shaped; toe box height is solid. I am pleased with the appearance 😍.\n\n⸻\n\n🖐️ **In Hand Feel:**\nThe shoe feels sturdy but not overly stiff. Decent weight in hand and does not feel “cheap” IMO. The padding around the ankle is plush, and the tongue has a good padding to it also. The leather is soft but firm. Feels like quality IMO.\n\n⸻\n\n🧵 **Stitching:**\nStitching is tidy and consistent throughout. No crazy flaws or loose threads, but the exterior of the right shoe’s toe elephant print’s double stitching is slightly too spaced. No one will notice this on foot. The double stitch pattern around the midsole and upper panels is clean and uniform though.\n\n⸻\n\n🔝 **Upper Material:**\nThe upper is a smooth tumbled leather, and it feels soft to the touch—feels above average and good quality. Doesn’t feel plasticky, and it has that nice grainy texture in the right lighting. \n\n⸻\n\n🐘 **Elephant Print:**\nThe elephant print is good but could be a bit more consistent. It’s a light off white grayish with white cracks. The scale pattern looks close to what I would anticipate from retail—just the right amount of contrast, but it’s too early to say definitely how retail will be. Placement around the toe is ever slightly inconsistent but no one will notice this on foot. The heel is consistent. This is fine 👍.\n\n⸻\n\n👟 **Heel Tab:**\nJumpman logo and “AIR” text on the heel tab are centered and crisp. No leaning or misalignment. Heel tab material feels sturdy but flexible. Bounces back well when pulled down to show the “Pure$” stitching. \n\n⸻\n\n🦶 **Sole:**\nOutsole is white with grey “JORDAN” lettering that pops out and is aligned correctly.  The traction pattern looks on point. The insole is white with a grey jumpman.\n\n⸻\n\n✅ **Conclusion:**\nOverall, this pair is a WIN from **RN.** I was surprised by the quality in hand. For the most part, the shape, materials, and build quality all check out.  This pair will release in 2025, so still a bit early to say how the official release will look next month, but you can wear these with confidence. I feel like this is a super solid cop. **RN delivered!** 🔥\n\n⸻\n\n**W2C:** TMF\n\n**Shipping:** 9 days to US\n\n**Price:** 390¥ + Shipping (if direct)\n\n**WhatsApp:** +8613735428664\n\nhttps://shop1809267573.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7336372745&wfr=BuyercopyURL&share_relation=26ba14118b469af2_1426155685_1&spider_token=95ef"

The Union “Chicago Shadow” colorway might be the best mashup Jordan Brand never officially released — and this PK batch from Zen hits the mark in all the right places. Toe box is clean, stitching is accurate, and the color blocking is as striking as ever. In hand, it feels premium, aged, and ready to rock.\n\n👟 **Shape & Build Quality**\n\n* **Toe Box:** Nicely shaped — slim and properly sloped. No ballooning or toe puff issues.\n* **Stitching:** Yellow zigzag exposed stitching at the collar line is clean, evenly spaced, and dead-on to retail pairs.\n* **Heel Structure:** Firm, holds shape, and transitions smoothly from the grey upper to the sail midsole.\n* **Wings Logo:** Crisp and clean embossing in the right location — no fading or misalignment.\n* **Union Tag:** Small, sharp, and properly sewn right into the collar seam.\n\n🎨 **Materials & Color**\n\n* **Leather:** Red forefoot and white panels are tumbled with good texture — soft, not plasticky.\n* **Black/Grey Panels:** Smooth matte finish, with that muted Shadow 1 look — no gloss, no over-dye.\n* **Tongue:** Vintage sail nylon with exposed foam, feels authentically aged but not overdone.\n* **Laces:** Comes with **three sets total**:\n\n  * Two-tone **black/cream**\n  * Two-tone **grey/black**\n  * Solid **Union yellow** — fire accent for swaps.\n* **Midsole:** Sail tone adds that aged vibe without going full pre-yellowed.\n\n🧼 **Comfort & Fit**\n\n* Fits true to size (TTS)\n* Classic Jordan 1 comfort — flat, but supportive\n* Slightly padded tongue and good collar support\n* Break-in is minimal — feels wearable out of the box\n\n⚡ **LORE:**\n\nThe Union LA x Air Jordan 1 “Chicago Shadow” is a grail-tier remix that never saw a retail release — a true what-if mashup of the “Chicago” toe and the “Shadow” upper, imagined through Chris Gibbs’ vintage thrifted lens. The original 2018 Union collab helped shift sneaker culture toward aged, boutique-inspired design with raw stitching, sail midsoles, and exposed foams.\n\nThis colorway in particular feels like a collector’s dream — aged leather, mismatched materials, and a bold but wearable palette. PK’s batch captures every stitch and panel like it came straight out of Union’s LA vault.\n\n🧠 **Final Thoughts**\n\nThis is one of the cleanest Union variants out there, and PK didn’t miss. Zen came through with a well-shaped, well-built, and highly detailed version of a pair most people wish got a wider release. From the triple lace set to the aged finish and premium materials, this is a standout piece in any Jordan rotation.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Ratings:**\n\n| Category  | Score  |\n| --------- | ------ |\n| Shape     | 9.3/10 |\n| Materials | 9.2/10 |\n| Accuracy  | 9.1/10 |\n| Comfort   | 9/10   |\n| Overall   | 9.2/10 |\n\n---\n\n**W2C:**\n\n**Zen**\n\n📲 WhatsApp: +852 4648 6065\n\n💰 Price: \\$140 shipped\n\n👉 Use code **NOKI** for a discount\n\n\n---\n",

    "full_text": "[ON-FEET REVIEW] Air Jordan 1 x Union LA “Chicago Shadow” (PK) from Zen **Seller:** Zen\n\n**Batch:** PK\n\n**Size:** 13\n\n**Price:** \\$140 shipped\n\n**Shipping Time:** 19 days to the EU\n\n---\n\n🔍 **First Impressions**\n\nStraight heat. The Union “Chicago Shadow” colorway might be the best mashup Jordan Brand never officially released — and this PK batch from Zen hits the mark in all the right places. Toe box is clean, stitching is accurate, and the color blocking is as striking as ever. In hand, it feels premium, aged, and ready to rock.\n\n👟 **Shape & Build Quality**\n\n* **Toe Box:** Nicely shaped — slim and properly sloped. No ballooning or toe puff issues.\n* **Stitching:** Yellow zigzag exposed stitching at the collar line is clean, evenly spaced, and dead-on to retail pairs.\n* **Heel Structure:** Firm, holds shape, and transitions smoothly from the grey upper to the sail midsole.\n* **Wings Logo:** Crisp and clean embossing in the right location — no fading or misalignment.\n* **Union Tag:** Small, sharp, and properly sewn right into the collar seam.\n\n🎨 **Materials & Color**\n\n* **Leather:** Red forefoot and white panels are tumbled with good texture — soft, not plasticky.\n* **Black/Grey Panels:** Smooth matte finish, with that muted Shadow 1 look — no gloss, no over-dye.\n* **Tongue:** Vintage sail nylon with exposed foam, feels authentically aged but not overdone.\n* **Laces:** Comes with **three sets total**:\n\n  * Two-tone **black/cream**\n  * Two-tone **grey/black**\n  * Solid **Union yellow** — fire accent for swaps.\n* **Midsole:** Sail tone adds that aged vibe without going full pre-yellowed.\n\n🧼 **Comfort & Fit**\n\n* Fits true to size (TTS)\n* Classic Jordan 1 comfort — flat, but supportive\n* Slightly padded tongue and good collar support\n* Break-in is minimal — feels wearable out of the box\n\n⚡ **LORE:**\n\nThe Union LA x Air Jordan 1 “Chicago Shadow” is a grail-tier remix that never saw a retail release — a true what-if mashup of the “Chicago” toe and the “Shadow” upper, imagined through Chris Gibbs’ vintage thrifted lens. The original 2018 Union collab helped shift sneaker culture toward aged, boutique-inspired design with raw stitching, sail midsoles, and exposed foams.\n\nThis colorway in particular feels like a collector’s dream — aged leather, mismatched materials, and a bold but wearable palette. PK’s batch captures every stitch and panel like it came straight out of Union’s LA vault.\n\n🧠 **Final Thoughts**\n\nThis is one of the cleanest Union variants out there, and PK didn’t miss. Zen came through with a well-shaped, well-built, and highly detailed version of a pair most people wish got a wider release. From the triple lace set to the aged finish and premium materials, this is a standout piece in any Jordan rotation.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Ratings:**\n\n| Category  | Score  |\n| --------- | ------ |\n| Shape     | 9.3/10 |\n| Materials | 9.2/10 |\n| Accuracy  | 9.1/10 |\n| Comfort   | 9/10   |\n| Overall   | 9.2/10 |\n\n---\n\n**W2C:**\n\n**Zen**\n\n📲 WhatsApp: +852 4648 6065\n\n💰 Price: \\$140 shipped\n\n👉 Use code **NOKI** for a discount\n\n\n---"

And at this point today, the Golan Heights have been Israeli over 3 times the time they were Syrian.\n\nTo sum it up, this war has greatly shaped the area, and it's consequences effect us all here to this day.\n\n[Photo source](https://www.idf.il/%D7%90%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%99%D7%97%D7%99%D7%93%D7%95%D7%AA/%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9E%D7%AA-%D7%A9%D7%A9%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9E%D7%AA-%D7%A9%D7%A9%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%92%D7%9C%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94/)"

True to the original 2014 release, the championship silhouette utilizes a one-piece scarlet suede upper with contrasting black accents on the tongue, collar lining and heel panel, marked with an embossed Jumpman and '23' in Vibrant Yellow. A matching yellow Jumpman badge decorates the lateral collar. Accented with faux carbon fiber detailing, the black Phylon midsole features an exposed chrome-plated chassis and springy Zoom Air units in the forefoot and heel.\n\n☎️ **W2C & Price:**\n\n* Whatsapp: +86 181 7007 3653\n* Instagram: Linn_886\n* Price: Mention “Repdad” discount code\n\n🚹 **Customer service experience:**\n\nThe whole conversation was smooth. They use high quality and most reliable shipping services like Fedex, DHL, Aramex, Royal Mail etc. After your package is shipped, they will provide you a tracking code within few days where you can track your package.\n\nQC photos are of satisfied quality taken from all angles where you can inspect the condition from every side. If you are not satisfied with your QC pair, my suggestion is to always ask for more pictures or daylight condition photos for reasurance, or simply exchange to a new pair if there is flaws.\n\nIf there is any issue with the seller, you can contact me privately. Good luck!\n",

Notable features include a removable Velcro tongue patch, reminiscent of MA-1 flight jacket patches, and two heel branding options: one with the classic “Nike Air” logo and another with the “Jumpman” logo. Both versions will come in special edition packaging.  ￼ ￼\n\nThe Undefeated x Air Jordan 4 is set to release on August 28, 2025, at a retail price of $225. It will be available through Undefeated stores, Nike.com, and select retailers.  ￼ ￼\n\nIn addition to the sneakers, Jordan Brand will release an MA-1 flight jacket-inspired Air Jordan Renegade Jacket, priced at $325, along with matching apparel to complete the collection.  ￼\n\nThis re-release offers both longtime fans and new collectors a chance to own a piece of sneaker history\n\n**REVIEW**\n\nAJ TRENDY SNEAKERS is an amazing seller!!

That backward Swoosh never gets old — and this LJR batch delivers the Travis “Mocha” vibe *perfectly*. Suede is rich and brushable, and the sail midsole has just the right amount of vintage tint. Shape looks great in-hand and even better on foot. Definitely feels like a top-tier rep.\n\n👟 **Shape & Build Quality**\n\n* **Toe Box:** Slim and properly sloped. No chunky bulge or collapsing — clean profile.\n* **Reverse Swoosh:** Great curve and placement. Slight overhang on the lateral edge just like retail.\n* **Heel Embroidery:** Cactus Jack face is sharp and centered, not warped or oversized.\n* **Collar/Wings Logo:** Nice embossing, solid ankle padding. Wings logo is crisp with correct spacing.\n\n🎨 **Materials & Color**\n\n* **Suede:** That mocha brown hits *perfectly* — soft to the touch with visible stroke motion. No bald spots or stiffness.\n* **White Leather:** Tumbled with a natural texture. Doesn’t look plastic or overly smooth.\n* **Sail Midsole:** Clean cream tone — not overly yellowed like some batches. Balances out the upper well.\n* **Details:** Cactus Jack text on the medial side is faint and placed correctly. Comes with all four lace options: pink, black, red, sail.\n\n🧼 **Comfort & Fit**\n\n* Fits true to size (TTS)\n* Classic AJ1 feel — supportive but flat. Breaks in nicely within a wear or two.\n* No heel slip, padding around the collar holds the foot in well\n* Great everyday comfort if you’re used to 1s\n\n⚡ **LORE:**\n\nThe Air Jordan 1 High OG x Travis Scott “Mocha” was one of the most disruptive collabs of the 2010s. Dropped in 2019, it flipped the iconic AJ1 design with a reversed Swoosh, earthy tones, and hidden stash pockets — instantly cementing its status as a modern classic.\n\nThe Mocha colorway blends rugged utility with streetwear luxury, and Travis’s influence is felt in every detail. This sneaker helped push Jordan retros into the hands of a new wave of fans and solidified La Flame’s role in sneaker culture.\n\nThis LJR batch brings that same iconic look to life, with accurate materials, solid shape, and the same visual punch that made the retail version a grail. If you missed out, this is the next best thing — no cap.\n\n🧠 **Final Thoughts**\n\nLJR does numbers on this one. Shape is on point, suede feels luxe, and all the Travis details are faithfully done. For \\$130 shipped, you’re getting something that punches way above its price tag.

Considering they were sent with triangle shipping, I really can’t complain too much about the shipping speed. LJR does have a minor flaws (the gray being a slightly wrong shade and some glue stains in some areas). Aside from those flaws, I’m very happy with these.\n\nRM WhatsApp: +44 7723 417168\n\n[W2C](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7424489911)\n\n[QC](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWorldOfRepsneakers/s/NJV0bVUhO2)"

They must just not give a shit. \n\nThis 100% gives me pause on buying *anything* Nike ever again. \n\nDo I have a weird foot? Did I just happen to get a bad pair? Or is this par for the course with the new Nike Air Max?"

    "selftext": "Just wanted to come on here and share a huge win for me. I have had insomnia for over 5 years. Sometimes not sleeping for 4-5 days at a time, only being able to sleep in my own bed/ not go on vacations or trips with my friends, living in complete and total fear of sleep deprivation to the point where it controlled every aspect of my life. My insomnia is due to anxiety/ fear of sleep loss (the fear of spending 1,2,3,4,5, days without sleep makes me so scared that I can't sleep), so this piece of advice may not be super applicable to those who experience medical insomnia. Anyways: I have avoided going on trips, vacations, sleeping over at anyone's house, and going out in general because I was scared to spend the next day sleepless. I booked a trip with my friends, and spent the following 4 months terrified, dreading this trip. At the last minute, I decided \"I can't do it. I won't sleep at all. I will have an awful time. My friends will have to take me back home and I will ruin it for everyone.\", so I stayed behind while they left. As I was sitting in my apartment, I heard a voice say \"just do it. GO. You are 23 years old. You can't let this take away your fun, your memories, your life. Even if you don't sleep for 4 days you won't die, at least you can say you tried. You can't keep isolating yourself like this.\" So I stopped what I was doing, got up and started packing. With all the motivation in me to live my life, and all the fear that this disorder would kill me, I drove all the way there myself. I did not sleep the first night, but I had an amazing day even without sleep. I was able to do everything that my friends did, and even had time to take a cat nap. You wouldn't believe what pushing myself as hard as I could did for me: I slept. I SLEPT ON THE TRIP!!! I expanded my capacity to go beyond what I thought I could do. I tired myself out by having such a good time in a different state, seeing things that I have never seen before. I made sure to have my own private room so that I could have my space to feel anxiety and do the things that made me feel comforted in my own home. It was not 8 hours of deep sleep, more like 4 hours, but that's normal for trips! I slept the third night even BETTER than the second too. I am so proud of myself, and I am ready to keep facing the fear of not sleeping and leaving my comfort zone. So here is my advice to those of you who experience sleep anxiety: JUST DO IT. GO ON THAT TRIP. A FEW DAYS WITHOUT SLEEP WON'T KILL YOU! EXPOSURE THERAPY REALLY COULD WORK!!",

    "selftext": "Most nights after dinner, I eat a small ice cream cone. It’s literally the little “joy mini cups” with a teeny scoop of ice cream. Maybe a big scoop if I’m having a rough day but that’s kinda rare. I don’t drink alcohol or smoke weed or do anything “fun” so this is my one fun thing I do for myself. \n\nMy brother and his wife and daughter are staying with me for a few weeks, they’ll be gone by June 15. I’m happy to have them here. Usually we’ll eat dinner together and go our separate ways for the evening. They watch a lot of TV so they’re usually all in the living room watching. \n\nI’ve been eating my lil cone, but my sister in law approached me and asked me if I could stop. She said that my niece is starting to ask why she doesn’t get to have ice cream and that obviously she was lied to by my sister in law when she told her ice cream is a sometimes food, haha. \n\nI said that I wasn’t going to stop but I could wait until she was in bed. I figured that was a good compromise and I do get that she’s trying to raise her little girl to have a healthy relationship with food. But waiting until she was in bed didn’t work because she came into the kitchen multiple times to ask me for some. \n\nMy SIL was definitely a little incredulous over it and kept saying “Really? Do you seriously NEED to eat ice cream every single day?” or stuff like it. I said no, but she also doesn’t need to drink a glass of wine every day either. She didn’t like this and sighed a bunch and has been visibly annoyed with me since then. My brother asked me if I could stop just to avoid the drama, but I said I deserve my little treats. AITA?\n\n  \n**Hi so I've decided to log off this post and not come back.** This post has just gotten completely out of control with really over the top overreactions and people trying to encourage me to make things worse or escalate and call my sil an alcoholic or to purposely eat more ice cream in front of my niece. Some of you are just like chomping at the bit to call people names and be sarcastic and nasty to me for no reason. That's not really what I was expecting and we're not allowed to delete posts so I'm just going to log out and move on. ",

    "selftext": "TLDR: My fiancé gets angry when i talk about money, currently we need to move to a bigger place for his daughter and he refuses to pay 50/50. Do I just accept that he can only pay a small portion of the bills and not question it despite his good income?\n\nFor context:\n\nMy fiancé and I have lived together for five months now. Currently I pay a majority of the bills about 70/30. Which I agreed to as this was my apartment first and was supposed to be temporary until we found a bigger place. (The plan was to split bills 50/50 when we moved). We are at a point now that we really need a bigger place. He has a daughter we have on the weekends and currently she is sleeping in the living room. \n\nWhen I asked him how much he can afford in rent he told me $600 a month TOTAL for his half of rent/electricity/Wi-Fi. He makes $65k annually usd, and has minimal other bills. Also prior to moving in with me, he paid $1100 a month in rent alone. So I’m not sure why now he can only afford $600. \n\nA few times now, I have asked him to sit down  with me and create a budget. As he makes enough money to pay more than $600 a month in bills. And quite frankly that won’t even cover half the rent for a 2 bedroom apartment in my city much less the added costs of utilities and WiFi. Every time this happens, he gets angry, yells at me accusing me of being judgmental when it comes to money and storms off. When truly all I care about is making sure that we get a bigger place with a room for his daughter. He refuses to make a budget and says that it’s unnecessary and that he’s a grown man who has never had to have one. \n\nAt this point, I believe he just expects me to shoulder paying more in bills and I feel a little used. I do make more money but not by much (75k usd). I’m just not sure what to do at this point do I just accept the amount he gave me and not question it? However, that puts me in a situation where I’m paying a majority of the bills, which I don’t feel is fair.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Seriously, I want to understand that criticism because the only thing I see that are similar are :\n\n1. You walk around in an abandoned area\n\n2. You get chased by ennemies\n\n3. It's a free roam 3d game\n\n4. There are cardboard cutouts which make noises\n\n5. There are puzzles for you to solve\n\n  \nBut when you actually look at the differences, you can see that :\n\n1. This game emphasises exploration by letting you explore a building and even backtrack to certain areas with a realistic layout and shortcuts that can even lead you to optional secret areas, instead of going from just point A to point B.\n\n2. The stealth sections are a lot more creative with them having only one enemy that can appear in any costume, blending well with the different areas. They also vary in how you have to progress through them in the game, for example by either gathering missing pieces or animatronic parts.\n\n3. The gameplay also varies with different and creative chase sequences like with Big top and Dollie.\n\n4. You have collectables which lets you achieve a secret ending with an unique inventory system.\n\n5. The puzzles are still very different and unique from the ones in Poppy playtime.\n\n5. There's still supernatural elements in this game, like with the Tiger rock costume seemingly being haunted chasing you in the basement section.\n\n6.

    "full_text": "Why do people keep dismissing this game by saying it's just a copy of Poppy Playtime ? Seriously, I want to understand that criticism because the only thing I see that are similar are :\n\n1. You walk around in an abandoned area\n\n2. You get chased by ennemies\n\n3. It's a free roam 3d game\n\n4. There are cardboard cutouts which make noises\n\n5. There are puzzles for you to solve\n\n  \nBut when you actually look at the differences, you can see that :\n\n1. This game emphasises exploration by letting you explore a building and even backtrack to certain areas with a realistic layout and shortcuts that can even lead you to optional secret areas, instead of going from just point A to point B.\n\n2. The stealth sections are a lot more creative with them having only one enemy that can appear in any costume, blending well with the different areas. They also vary in how you have to progress through them in the game, for example by either gathering missing pieces or animatronic parts.\n\n3. The gameplay also varies with different and creative chase sequences like with Big top and Dollie.\n\n4. You have collectables which lets you achieve a secret ending with an unique inventory system.\n\n5. The puzzles are still very different and unique from the ones in Poppy playtime.\n\n5. There's still supernatural elements in this game, like with the Tiger rock costume seemingly being haunted chasing you in the basement section.\n\n6. There are multiple endings.\n\n  \nTLDR, even if there are some similarities, SOTM still has a **TON** of different elements that makes it unique  and great in its execution than other mascot horror games."

Everything seems perfect and pretty close to retail, only con that i have is the swoosh, even on the updated m batch, is still a little too light green, but its not very noticeable.\n\nZen is a trusted seller from our list, the whole experience has been very pleasant, QC pics were perfect. You can use my code NOKI for a discount and if you have any problems with the seller feel free to contact me personally and we’ll sort things out.\n\n••TIMELINE••\n\nOrdered and payed: 19.10\n\nReceived QC: 19.10\n\nReceived tracking code: 21.10\n\nReceived the shoes: 31.10\n\n••W2C••\n\nWhatsapp: +85246486065\n\nPrice: $125 shipped with the code NOKI"

Not to mention the dunk contest needs to be rejuvenated somehow\n\n4 - Corporate redesign of awards\nThis is minor but a few years ago they redesigned all the end of season awards, they knocked it out the park with the MVP trophy and then just, gave up? The DPOY used to look like a big defensive trophy, now it looks like you won best regional sales manager at your companies awards night. It’s also basically indistinguishable from the 6MOY, MIP and ROY\n\n5 - Nikes Jersey model\nThis is more about the city jerseys than anything but the Nike jersey model is terrible, to begin every new Nike jersey basically sucked (we seem to be on a correction course now) but especially city jerseys where fans are subjected to a whole year of pushing these jerseys that are ass (especially because they’ve been redesigned every single year so they run out of ideas) all because they need sales up for the jerseys, especially in the playoffs.\n\n6 - The technicals\nBy god, the technicals. Dudes getting Td up for showing any kind of emotion because silver wants a respectable product, a league built off of guys like Iverson, Jordan, Bird, Shaq who got in their opponents faces, celebrated loudly and now we have ridiculous techs on pretty normal celebrations, it’s like there’s a no taunting rule. AIs step over would’ve had him ejected in this day.\n\nTo finish this isn’t a rant that “the NBA was better back in the day” but the vibe of the nba most certainly was, the players, the drama, the legacy building it’s all still here but it’s just starting to look boring, and Adam Silver needs to bring back some of the stuff he took away that has slowly decayed the feel of the league.

    "title": "The Nike Swoosh Effect: Why This Simple Mark Dominates Our World",
    "selftext": "Close your eyes for a moment. Picture a logo. Any logo. Chances are, the first image that flashed in your mind was a simple, elegant curve. The [Nike Swoosh](https://weandthecolor.com/how-the-nike-swoosh-logo-became-a-global-icon/203651). It’s a mark so deeply embedded in our culture that it feels less like corporate branding and more like a fundamental symbol, like a plus sign or an arrow. You don’t even need to see the word \"Nike\" to know exactly what it represents.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2aol36ol5g6f1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0f16d2332c7b0f99a3b0db613b60644027fff99\n\nBut have you ever truly considered why? Why does this specific shape hold so much power over our collective imagination? The journey of the **Nike Swoosh** is a fascinating study in design, psychology, and masterful marketing. It’s the story of how a fluid line, born from a tight deadline, became the silent narrator for countless stories of human triumph. Let's deconstruct the elements that make this logo a masterclass in visual communication.\n\n# The Anatomy of a Perfect Mark\n\nBefore we get to its history, let's look at the shape itself. The genius of the **Nike Swoosh** is what it communicates without a single word. Its design is a visual vocabulary of positive ideas.\n\nFirst, there is the undeniable sense of motion. The shape is not static; it’s a verb. It arcs forward, suggesting speed, agility, and a smooth, efficient trajectory. It’s the \"whoosh\" of an athlete sprinting past you, the blur of a ball flying through the air. Your brain processes this movement instantly. This dynamism makes it the perfect emblem for a sportswear company.\n\nBut there’s another, more subtle layer at play. What does the shape also resemble? A checkmark. Think about what a checkmark means to you. It signifies correctness, approval, success, and the completion of a task. This positive affirmation is baked directly into the logo's DNA. Every time you see the **Nike Swoosh**, you get a tiny, subconscious dose of \"yes, you can.\" It's a visual pat on the back.\n\n# A Student, a Deadline, and a Reluctant \"Yes\"\n\nThe creation of this global symbol was surprisingly understated. In 1971, Phil Knight, the co-founder of what was then Blue Ribbon Sports, was preparing to launch a new line of shoes. He needed a logo, and he needed it quickly. He turned to a graphic design student at Portland State University, Carolyn Davidson, whom he had met while teaching.\n\nThe brief was simple: create a \"stripe\" that looked fast. Davidson spent over 17 hours sketching, exploring concepts that captured the essence of movement. When she presented her options, none of the executives were immediately sold. Knight, looking at the curved checkmark, famously remarked, \"Well, I don't love it, but maybe it will grow on me.\"\n\nWith production deadlines pressing, they chose the design. Davidson submitted her invoice for $35. It’s one of the most legendary transactions in business history. It proves that a world-changing idea doesn't need a monumental budget, just the right spark of insight.\n\n# Engineering a Global Mindset with the Nike Swoosh\n\nA logo, no matter how well-designed, is only a symbol. It needs a story and a mission to give it life. This is where Nike’s branding strategy transformed the **Nike Swoosh** from a simple mark into a cultural phenomenon.\n\nFor years, the logo was paired with the company name. But in 1988, everything changed with three simple words: \"Just Do It.\" This campaign, created by the Wieden+Kennedy agency, was a stroke of pure genius. It wasn't about selling shoes; it was about selling a mindset. It was a direct, empowering command to overcome inertia and self-doubt.\n\n\"Just Do It\" gave the silent **Nike Swoosh** a powerful voice. The logo was no longer just about the grace of a finished movement; it was about the gritty decision to start. It became a symbol for that internal battle we all face before we run, before we jump, before we try. The Swoosh became the banner under which you fought that battle.\n\n# Achieving Wordless Recognition\n\nBy the mid-1990s, Nike's brand identity was so strong that it made an incredibly bold move. It began removing the word \"NIKE\" from its products and advertising, leaving only the standalone Swoosh. This was the ultimate flex in the branding world. It was a confident declaration that their symbol had transcended the need for a name.\n\nThink about what that means. The company trusted that a simple shape could carry the entire weight of its brand, its history, and its ethos. And it worked. The \"nameless\" **Nike Swoosh** became even more powerful. It felt more personal, more universal. It wasn't just a company's logo anymore; it was our symbol for aspiration and action. It had achieved a level of recognition that few brands in history ever will.\n\n# Why the Swoosh Endures and Thrives\n\nSo why does the **Nike Swoosh** continue to feel so relevant today? Its endurance comes from a perfect balance of consistency and evolution.\n\nNike has fiercely protected the logo's core identity. It is always associated with top-tier athletes and moments of peak performance. The Swoosh was on Michael Jordan's shoes as he defied gravity, and on Serena Williams' visor as she dominated the court. The logo absorbs the excellence of those who wear it, continuously recharging its meaning.\n\nAt the same time, Nike allows the Swoosh to be a canvas for culture. High-profile collaborations with designers like Virgil Abloh or brands like Tiffany & Co. have seen the logo reinterpreted in countless ways. It can be deconstructed, stitched, or reimagined in new materials, yet its core shape remains instantly recognizable. This adaptability keeps it fresh and exciting for each new generation.\n\nIn the end, the **Nike Swoosh** is more than just a logo. It is a compact, visual poem about human potential. It’s a testament to the power of simplicity and the magic that happens when a great design is fused with an even greater story.\n\nThe Nike name and the Swoosh logo are registered trademarks of Nike, Inc.\n\n\\---\n\nContent source: [https://weandthecolor.com/how-the-nike-swoosh-logo-became-a-global-icon/203651](https://weandthecolor.com/how-the-nike-swoosh-logo-became-a-global-icon/203651)",

I struggled with stability during the race, and I didn’t feel as comfortable as I had hoped. For daily training, I’ve been using the **ON Cloudmonster 1**, and I absolutely love it for its cushioning and comfort.\n\nNow, I’ve got a 10K race coming up, and I typically run at a pace of **7 minutes per** km (about **11:15 per mile**). I’m wondering if any of you could share your experiences with ON shoes for a longer race. I’m torn between the Cloudmonster 2 and Cloudmonster Hyper, which would be better for this distance and pace?\n\nAlso, I’ve had a really good experience with the Nike React Infinity, which felt great for both training and long runs.\n\nWhat do you guys think?

They just released some new colorways for the Asics Superblast 2 here and they look better with more premium uppers, albeit at twice the price. I tried the SB 2 on and it felt more stable but with a fuller stack height. There is a bit more of a rocker at the heel.

So you buy their $10 t-shirt 2 times per year instead of 1 time like many years ago. I think there should be some brands that still keep the quality of their product.

The second pair of the left shoe is perfect, but the right shoe has multiple scuffs on the front. If I keep one of the and one of the rights from two different pairs, then I have a perfect pair.

I’m 1.7m tall and weigh 74kg and wear a Nike US size 9. My main sport is weightlifting/powerlifting, and running is a secondary hobby for me.\n\n**Environment:**\n\n* Mid/ Forefoot striker\n* Live in tropical SEA, it gets really hot and humid here with lots of rain.\n* Open to exploring all types of cushioning\n\nHere's how my typical running load looks:\n\n**Off-season (not training for a race):**  \n• 2x/week  \n• 1 Long Run (up to 18km)  \n• 1 Tempo or Interval Run (within 10km)\n\n**10K training phase:**  \n• 3–4x/week  \n• 1 Easy Run (<10km)  \n• 1 Long Run (up to 14km)  \n• 1–2 Tempo/Interval Runs (≤10km)\n\nI currently run in a pair of Nike Downshifter 13s, which I got for cheap at $35, they've accumulated around 300km in distance. I’m looking to upgrade to something better suited for my goals.\n\n**Goal:** Improve my 10K race time. I have no interest in training for half or full marathons anytime soon as it would interfere with my weightlifting progress.\n\nThese are the three shoes I’m considering, in order of preference:\n\n1. **Asics Novablast 5** – $145\n2. **Nike Zoom Fly 6** – $125\n3. **New Balance FuelCell Rebel v4** – $135\n\nIf you had to pick **just one** running shoe from the above, which would you choose and why? Love to hear your thoughts, especially if you have a similar background or have used any of these shoes for 10K training.",

My main sport is weightlifting/powerlifting, and running is a secondary hobby for me.\n\n**Environment:**\n\n* Mid/ Forefoot striker\n* Live in tropical SEA, it gets really hot and humid here with lots of rain.\n* Open to exploring all types of cushioning\n\nHere's how my typical running load looks:\n\n**Off-season (not training for a race):**  \n• 2x/week  \n• 1 Long Run (up to 18km)  \n• 1 Tempo or Interval Run (within 10km)\n\n**10K training phase:**  \n• 3–4x/week  \n• 1 Easy Run (<10km)  \n• 1 Long Run (up to 14km)  \n• 1–2 Tempo/Interval Runs (≤10km)\n\nI currently run in a pair of Nike Downshifter 13s, which I got for cheap at $35, they've accumulated around 300km in distance. I’m looking to upgrade to something better suited for my goals.\n\n**Goal:** Improve my 10K race time. I have no interest in training for half or full marathons anytime soon as it would interfere with my weightlifting progress.\n\nThese are the three shoes I’m considering, in order of preference:\n\n1. **Asics Novablast 5** – $145\n2. **Nike Zoom Fly 6** – $125\n3. **New Balance FuelCell Rebel v4** – $135\n\nIf you had to pick **just one** running shoe from the above, which would you choose and why? Love to hear your thoughts, especially if you have a similar background or have used any of these shoes for 10K training."

1l04m56,"Costco, Best Buy, Nike, Walmart, Target and Macy’s among the retailers raising prices as Trump tariffs take hold","> Consumers who hoped tariffs would not hit their wallets keep getting bad news. As they reported earnings in recent weeks, multiple major retailers said they have already raised some prices or plan to hike them in the coming weeks to offset the duties. They include major grocers and consumer goods sellers Costco, Best Buy, Walmart and Target. President Donald Trump’s ever-changing trade policy has roiled retailers as they try to plan their supply chains. On earnings calls, they faced the difficult task of trying to appease investors who want them to protect their bottom lines and shoppers who could balk at price hikes.

> In some cases, companies have been explicit, citing the estimated toll tariffs will take on their bottom lines and breaking down which countries their supply chains rely on. Other retailers have been less forthcoming, avoiding the word “tariff” and instead blaming strategy shifts or price hikes on “macroeconomic uncertainty” — or simply refusing to point the finger at all.

> Many retailers have reduced or withdrawn their full-year guidance because of tariffs. Companies such as Abercrombie & Fitch, Macy’s and Best Buy have slashed their profit outlooks. Meanwhile, American Eagle, Canada Goose, Ross and Mattel pulled their full-year guidance.

> Economists on both sides of the aisle agree that tariffs are inflationary and the cost will likely be passed on to consumers, though government data has not showed a clear effect yet. A majority, 68%, of U.S. CEOs say they have either increased prices already or are considering doing so this year in the face of tariffs, according to a new survey by Chief Executive Group and AlixPartners.

1l720zy,Got 3 Shoes instead of 1 Nike,"I'm 20M, and I've never owned a pair of Nike shoes. Since January, I’d been saving up to buy the Nike Dunk Lows, and I managed to save around 5k (coming from a middle-class background). But all the Dunks I liked were priced above 8-9k. So, I gave up on the idea for now and decided to buy three different shoes for different occasions instead.

1st Pair - Urban Blaze: Phantom:
Got these from The Souled Store and I absolutely love the color. These are for college events and special occasions. They're more comfortable than I expected, though the soles could’ve been a bit more cushioned. Other than that, they’re just perfect.
Price: ₹2,500

2nd Pair - Puma ST Runner V4 L (Leather):
Got these from Flipkart for daily college use. They're very comfortable and fit really well. Very soft and cushioned soles and looks slick.
Price: ₹1,700

3rd Pair - Campus Men's Hurricane Running Shoes:
I bought these for the gym and evening walks. They look decent, are quite comfortable, and super lightweight. Perfect for the gym, I'd say.
Price: ₹700

So I spent a total of Rs. 4900 and saved 100 rupees.🥹

I’ll buy them as soon as I land a job. 🥲👍🏻",_hazzastyles,1749467480.0,2025-06-09 11:11:20,888,0.96,197,SneakersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l720zy,https://reddit.com/r/SneakersIndia/comments/1l720zy/got_3_shoes_instead_of_1_nike/,Nike,"Got 3 Shoes instead of 1 Nike I'm 20M, and I've never owned a pair of Nike shoes.

1ld7vnh,Nike Employee Discount Revoked,"Anyone know who to contact to fight this? Former employee that worked for 5+ years at Nike. I left the company about 2 and a half years ago. I have over 300+ pairs of Nike/Jordan shoes in my collection and have never resold any of the product. If they were to ask me about any product I’ve purchased with my employee discount, it’s in my collection. There have been rare occasions where I purchase two pairs of a new shoe that hits swoosh for the sense to have one to rock and one to stock for later on. Any shoe I have multiple pairs of as well, I still have. I went out of state about a month ago and went to a different Nike store and purchased three pairs from that store which I still have the pairs. That was the only thing that came to mind (using discount in another state) but my account has never been flagged or anything. Don’t know where the “inappropriate use of employee discount” comes into play either because I’m always buying my (size 11-12) depending on the shoe. Rare occasions I’ll buy shoes as like a birthday gift, Christmas, etc. with money out of my pocket. I’ve paid with my own debit card, credit card, cashapp card when making these purchases.

1lo0iol,"Nike fudged Kipyegon's ""official"" time in her sub-4 mile attempt to make it look faster","Nike fudged Kipyegon's ""official"" time in Breaking4 -- it's bad and Nike should feel bad.  

When Kipyegon crosses the finish line, the clock stops at 4:06.91 ([see video here](https://www.youtube.com/live/kZNHaUtLCnA?si=oet2EeUDgLPjt3km&t=3663)) and the commentator [says ""4:06.91.""](https://www.youtube.com/live/kZNHaUtLCnA?si=yIXhgExpON4sffJl&t=3674)   But a minute later, the male commentor states ""4:06.42 is the official time for Faith Kipyegon at the mile"" ([see here](https://www.youtube.com/live/kZNHaUtLCnA?si=cRIvMl07-6UfGKrv&t=3737)), and 4:06.42 is what Nike has subsequently reported as Kipyegon's ""official"" time for the event.  

Now, track times are adjusted from time to time, but 0.49 is a *huge* adjustment (adjustments are typically limited to a few hundredths of a second).  

Runners World [reached out to Nike for an explanation](https://www.runnersworld.com/news/a65234650/faith-kipyegon-breaking-4-timing/) and received the following from Nike:

>We captured precise timing for her 1-mile run—from Faith’s very first movement to the finish line, every frame was tracked using high-resolution photo-finish camera technology to ensure accuracy.

It appears that 4:06.42 is Faith's time if the clock started when Faith **crossed the starting line**. That is, her ""chip time"" (if you are familiar with open road races) -- it subtracts out Faith's reaction time and her first movement.  While the 4:06.91 we saw on the clock, and that was originally announced, is her ""gun time"" -- *i.e.*, the time starts when the gun goes off --- which is how ***every single*** track race across the world has been timed forever.   

Although the 0.49 second difference is ultimately irrelevant here, what if Faith had instead run a ""gun time"" of 4:00.48?   Then Nike would have reported Faith's time as 3:59.99 -- her chip time (*i.e.*, time starting when she crosses the start line) -- and the world would have thought she broke 4:00.00, even though she did not.  

It's clear that Nike was intentionally doing this to make Faith's time look better.  Because this is not how track times are reported and they know that.  It's just disappointing to see Nike fudge this.

1lcoget,What to gift a guy who has everything?,"Hey fellas!
I’m looking for a nice gift for my boyfriend for our 1-year anniversary, but my budget is kinda tight — around ₹1500 only 😭
We’re completing one year soon and I’ve got just one week to buy or order something.

The problem is... he literally already has everything! He uses expensive stuff like Armani Exchange for clothes, Azzaro perfumes, Air Jordans etc.
And then there’s me... a simple, middle-class girl trying to find something thoughtful and usable without selling my kidney 😩

I’ve already gifted him a backpack, wallet, shirt, and tees in the past.
Also, I don’t want to do anything handwritten or overly DIY this time — I want something he can actually use.

Any ideas for something affordable but meaningful or practical? I'm genuinely stuck here 🥲



Edit: A lot of y’all are assuming things 😂 Just to clarify — I’ve never taken money from him. He buys nice stuff for himself, and I’m just trying to give him something thoughtful from my small budget.

Obviously was a LS release so it only came out at Footaction and some mom and pop stores around me and every store only had like 5-6 pairs at max. Had to end up buying an ugly ass shirt to go with them though to be able to buy them from the mom and pop store but they were worth it.  Definitely in my top 3-5 Air Jordan V colorway.

1l8fo74,(In-Hand Review) Air Jordan 3 “Pure Money” 2025 (RN Batch) from TMF ✨👟,"Back again with another in-hand review and this time it’s the **Air Jordan 3 “Pure Money” 2025 (RN Batch)!** Let’s get into it 🔍



* This is for informational purposes only. You are entitled to your own opinion of the details I discuss. This review is my opinion of this pair.*


First off… **Shoutout TMF!** What can I say TMF is awesome.  TMF was patient and responsive and helped RL with ease when I needed to… This pair only took 9 days from the GL✅  🔼 ✈️  to my door!  **WhatsApp and W2C Link below my review.** 



⸻

👀 **Appearance:**
Straight out of the box, these are *clean.* The all-white colorway hits hard with the subtle silver accents. It’s got that icy, premium look—super wearable and lowkey but still stands out. The silhouette looks accurate and well-shaped; toe box height is solid. I am pleased with the appearance 😍.

⸻

🖐️ **In Hand Feel:**
The shoe feels sturdy but not overly stiff. Decent weight in hand and does not feel “cheap” IMO. The padding around the ankle is plush, and the tongue has a good padding to it also. The leather is soft but firm. Feels like quality IMO.

⸻

🧵 **Stitching:**
Stitching is tidy and consistent throughout. No crazy flaws or loose threads, but the exterior of the right shoe’s toe elephant print’s double stitching is slightly too spaced. No one will notice this on foot. The double stitch pattern around the midsole and upper panels is clean and uniform though.

⸻

🔝 **Upper Material:**
The upper is a smooth tumbled leather, and it feels soft to the touch—feels above average and good quality. Doesn’t feel plasticky, and it has that nice grainy texture in the right lighting. 

⸻

🐘 **Elephant Print:**
The elephant print is good but could be a bit more consistent. It’s a light off white grayish with white cracks. The scale pattern looks close to what I would anticipate from retail—just the right amount of contrast, but it’s too early to say definitely how retail will be. Placement around the toe is ever slightly inconsistent but no one will notice this on foot. The heel is consistent. This is fine 👍.

⸻

👟 **Heel Tab:**
Jumpman logo and “AIR” text on the heel tab are centered and crisp. No leaning or misalignment. Heel tab material feels sturdy but flexible. Bounces back well when pulled down to show the “Pure$” stitching. 

⸻

🦶 **Sole:**
Outsole is white with grey “JORDAN” lettering that pops out and is aligned correctly.  The traction pattern looks on point. The insole is white with a grey jumpman.

⸻

✅ **Conclusion:**
Overall, this pair is a WIN from **RN.** I was surprised by the quality in hand. For the most part, the shape, materials, and build quality all check out.  This pair will release in 2025, so still a bit early to say how the official release will look next month, but you can wear these with confidence. I feel like this is a super solid cop. **RN delivered!** 🔥

Am I nitpicking guys? 

First I want to say that I have already ordered this pair. I RL the first pair that I got QC pictures of but I didn't want to lose my chance to buy a pair from this latest restock from LJR so I bought this one.

But after all the research I have done I feel a little bit disappointed. Everybody is praising the LJR Batch as the best one but the majority of the QC album I have checked in the last month for this model have some minor flaws. Especially in the midsole and outsole area. (Excessive glue, white spots in the black area of the midsole like my pair and minor disfigurements in the outsole area also like my pair, etc).

My communication with RepsMaster was excellent, I have no complaints about his service. He was patient with all my questions and had ultra fast response time in my messages. The only thing I have to add is that I ordered four pairs of shoes from him in the last month and in three pairs out of four had to RL the first pairs due to minor flaws. Is this a pattern? Do the factories he works with sent him a pair with minor flaws first and if the client RL the first pair then the factories send him a better pair? Maybe I was just unlucky with the particular pairs and batches I ordered.",RedditSavedMyCat,1751106436.0,2025-06-28 10:27:16,19,0.95,37,RepsneakersDogs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lmjkwd,https://reddit.com/r/RepsneakersDogs/comments/1lmjkwd/qc_air_jordan_5_offwhite_muslin_ljr_batch_from/,Air Jordan,"[QC] Air Jordan 5 Off-White Muslin | LJR Batch | From RepsMaster Price: 520¥ + 200¥ Shipping

1l55gb8,[ON-FEET REVIEW] Air Jordan 3 x A Ma Maniére “While You Were Sleeping” (OG Batch) from Zen,"Seller: Zen

Batch: OG

Size: 13

Price: $140 shipped

Shipping Time: 19 days to the EU

🔍 First Impressions

Out of the box, these are luxury in sneaker form. The black tumbled leather hits hard — buttery soft to the touch — and the violet ore suede overlays are perfectly muted but rich. The aged midsole gives them that worn-in, story-driven vibe that A Ma Maniére is known for. Instantly felt like a premium product.

👟 Shape & Build Quality

Toe Box: Clean shape, nice low profile. No toe puffiness or excess bulk.

Heel: Nike Air branding is crisp and placed accurately. Stitching all around is tight.

Panels: Everything aligns nicely — no warping or miscuts. The suede paneling wraps smoothly.

Tongue Height: Slightly shorter than retail, but it works. AMM and Jumpman tags are centered and well-stitched.

🎨 Materials & Color

Leather: Tumbled and soft, feels high-end. No creasing issues even on foot.

Suede: Violet ore suede is luxe. Good texture and color saturation — not ashy or flat.

Lining: That diamond-quilted satin interior is just chef’s kiss. Feels like you're stepping into a designer chair.

Colorway: The combo of black, violet ore, and flat pewter with the vintage sole gives these a heritage-luxury blend that just works. Pops under natural light without being loud.

🧼 Comfort & Fit

Fits true to size (TTS)

Padding around the collar is plush — no break-in needed

Solid heel lock and forefoot room

Feels wearable all day without fatigue

⚡ LORE:

The Air Jordan 3 Retro OG SP A Ma Maniére While You Were Sleeping (Women’s) is a stunning continuation of the celebrated partnership between A Ma Maniére and Jordan Brand. Known for its luxury aesthetics and storytelling, A Ma Maniére delivers yet another masterpiece with this black, violet ore, and flat pewter colorway. The sneaker, part of the larger ""While You Were Sleeping"" collection, stays true to the brand's signature style with premium materials and thoughtful design details. This release carries the same high standard that made the first A Ma Maniére Jordan 3 an instant classic.

This iteration features a black tumbled leather upper paired with premium suede overlays, creating a sophisticated yet edgy look. The violet ore accents subtly elevate the design, adding a unique touch that distinguishes it from other releases. A vintage-inspired midsole and outsole bring a worn-in, timeless vibe that fits perfectly with A Ma Maniére’s carefully curated aesthetic. Details like the Nike Air branding on the heel and the mix of Jumpman and A Ma Maniére logos on the tongues further emphasize the sneaker’s premium appeal. Inside, the diamond-quilted lining delivers that luxurious feel the brand is known for.

Released on August 20, 2024, the Air Jordan 3 Retro OG A Ma Maniére (While You Were Sleeping) edition retailed at $250. With its striking black, flat pewter, and violet ore colorway, this sneaker is the perfect fusion of luxury and heritage. As a highly anticipated drop, it showcases the elevated craftsmanship and storytelling that A Ma Maniére brings to every collaboration. Whether you’re a collector or someone looking to step up your style, this Jordan 3 is a must-have addition to any sneaker rotation.

🧠 Final Thoughts

This OG batch from Zen really brings the A Ma Maniére 3s to life. From materials to shape to feel, it delivers a high-end experience at a fraction of retail. If you're looking for a pair that nails the storytelling and still turns heads on-foot, this is it. Absolutely staying in the rotation.

P.S. This pair is almost 9 months old, one of the first reps I ever got and I’ve worn them quite a bit. They held up tremendously, I gotta hand it to OG factory, these shoes are comfortable and durable.

1lawm0p,[ON-FEET REVIEW] Air Jordan 1 x Union LA “Chicago Shadow” (PK) from Zen,"**Seller:** Zen

**Batch:** PK

**Size:** 13

**Price:** \$140 shipped

**Shipping Time:** 19 days to the EU

---

🔍 **First Impressions**

Straight heat. The Union “Chicago Shadow” colorway might be the best mashup Jordan Brand never officially released — and this PK batch from Zen hits the mark in all the right places. Toe box is clean, stitching is accurate, and the color blocking is as striking as ever. In hand, it feels premium, aged, and ready to rock.

👟 **Shape & Build Quality**

* **Toe Box:** Nicely shaped — slim and properly sloped. No ballooning or toe puff issues.
* **Stitching:** Yellow zigzag exposed stitching at the collar line is clean, evenly spaced, and dead-on to retail pairs.
* **Heel Structure:** Firm, holds shape, and transitions smoothly from the grey upper to the sail midsole.
* **Wings Logo:** Crisp and clean embossing in the right location — no fading or misalignment.
* **Union Tag:** Small, sharp, and properly sewn right into the collar seam.

🎨 **Materials & Color**

* **Leather:** Red forefoot and white panels are tumbled with good texture — soft, not plasticky.
* **Black/Grey Panels:** Smooth matte finish, with that muted Shadow 1 look — no gloss, no over-dye.
* **Tongue:** Vintage sail nylon with exposed foam, feels authentically aged but not overdone.
* **Laces:** Comes with **three sets total**:

  * Two-tone **black/cream**
  * Two-tone **grey/black**
  * Solid **Union yellow** — fire accent for swaps.
* **Midsole:** Sail tone adds that aged vibe without going full pre-yellowed.

🧼 **Comfort & Fit**

* Fits true to size (TTS)
* Classic Jordan 1 comfort — flat, but supportive
* Slightly padded tongue and good collar support
* Break-in is minimal — feels wearable out of the box

⚡ **LORE:**

The Union LA x Air Jordan 1 “Chicago Shadow” is a grail-tier remix that never saw a retail release — a true what-if mashup of the “Chicago” toe and the “Shadow” upper, imagined through Chris Gibbs’ vintage thrifted lens. The original 2018 Union collab helped shift sneaker culture toward aged, boutique-inspired design with raw stitching, sail midsoles, and exposed foams.

This colorway in particular feels like a collector’s dream — aged leather, mismatched materials, and a bold but wearable palette. PK’s batch captures every stitch and panel like it came straight out of Union’s LA vault.

🧠 **Final Thoughts**

This is one of the cleanest Union variants out there, and PK didn’t miss. Zen came through with a well-shaped, well-built, and highly detailed version of a pair most people wish got a wider release. From the triple lace set to the aged finish and premium materials, this is a standout piece in any Jordan rotation.

1l7xyk5,"[Glasspiegel] Smith added that Jordan will call him to disagree with things he said on-air, and while he’s not as aggressive about it as Kobe Bryant used to be, he’s “candid.”
“I don’t think he’s going to be shy about saying what he sees—at all,” Smith concluded.","Stephen A. Smith doesn’t think Michael Jordan will hold back his true thoughts on TV.

At upfronts last month, NBC announced that Jordan would be a special contributor when it resumes its NBA coverage later this year. Basketball fans have been cautiously optimistic that we will get the version of Jordan from the Last Dance documentary, where he chomped cigars and was ruthless about rivals and critics, as opposed to a politician hesitant to offend his constituents.

Smith appeared on Patrick Bet-David’s PBD Podcast last week and made it sound like Jordan, whom he talks to with some regularity, is ready to speak with candor. 

“Let me tell you something about Michael Jordan: He’s going to be brutally honest—I can assure you that,” Smith said. “He’s not going to be somebody who’s going to be passive. … The Michael Jordan I know, when talking basketball, he is as candid as it gets. He ain’t trying to hurt nobody’s feelings. He ain’t trying to be insulting—but he’s going to tell you what’s going on.” 

“I don’t think he’s going to be passive at all. I really, really don’t, and I’m actually proud of him for doing it because, with the Jordan brand and him being worth over $2 billion, he don’t need this,” Smith continued. 

Smith said he urged Jordan to take on more public commentary, telling him to “stop acting like you have nothing to say about basketball now that you’re retired—you talk about it all the damn time!” 

Smith added Jordan will call him to disagree with things he said on-air, and while he’s not as aggressive about it as Kobe Bryant used to be, he’s “candid.”

“I don’t think he’s going to be shy about saying what he sees—at all,” Smith concluded. “As a matter of fact, if he is, he’s going to have to deal with me because I’m going to be in his ear telling him, ‘You’re getting shy now. That’s what we’re doing? That ain’t the MJ I know!’”

Elsewhere in the segment, Bet-David referenced internet rumors that NBC is paying Jordan $40 million annually. A source tells Front Office Sports that this number, which is about twice what Charles Barkley makes per year from TNT, is inaccurate. NBC declined to comment.

1lkdqvm,[REVIEW] Awake NY x Air Jordan 5 ‘Arctic Pink’ from Cashinn 🔥🔥🔥,"✍️ **Brief description:**

The highly anticipated Awake NY x Air Jordan 5collaboration is set to release in 2025. This special edition revamps the classic Air Jordan 5 while honoring the OG “Fire Red” colorway with a modern twist. Awake NY brings its unique New York-inspired design to this iconic silhouette.

The sneaker features soft pink leather uppers instead of the traditional white. Key elements like the black midsole, translucent outsole, and red sockliner remain intact. The lateral side netting showcases Awake NY’s signature “A” logo, adding a distinct touch. Meanwhile, the right shoe’s lateral heel swaps the classic “23” embroidery for “NY,” reinforcing the brand’s deep connection to its hometown. Adding to the excitement, a second “Black/Racer Blue” colorway is rumored to release alongside the “Arctic Pink” edition.

The Awake NY x Air Jordan 5 “Arctic Pink” is scheduled to launch on August 16, 2025

The highly anticipated Awake NY x Air Jordan 5collaboration is set to release in 2025. This special edition revamps the classic Air Jordan 5 while honoring the OG “Fire Red” colorway with a modern twist. Awake NY brings its unique New York-inspired design to this iconic silhouette.

The sneaker features soft pink leather uppers instead of the traditional white. Key elements like the black midsole, translucent outsole, and red sockliner remain intact. The lateral side netting showcases Awake NY’s signature “A” logo, adding a distinct touch. Meanwhile, the right shoe’s lateral heel swaps the classic “23” embroidery for “NY,” reinforcing the brand’s deep connection to its hometown. Adding to the excitement, a second “Black/Racer Blue” colorway is rumored to release alongside the “Arctic Pink” edition.

The Awake NY x Air Jordan 5 “Arctic Pink” is scheduled to launch on August 16, 2025

1l810s8,"TDIH: 10.06, 1967, following just 6 days of fighting, the Six-Day War has ended with an overwhelming Israeli victory, against multiple Arab nations. Here are some less known photos from the IDF's collection in their website.","Following Egypt's declaration of war by blocking naval routes, calling up UN peacekeepers to leave, and the making of genocidal threats, together with Syria encouraging terrorists, and threatening to cut the Jordan river's water source, Israel has decided to launch a surprise attack instead of waiting for it's enemies to strike on their terms.

Israeli air force managed to surprise the Egyptian, Syrians, Jordanians and Iraqis, crippling their capabilities, and getting a huge advantage in a risky gambit.

Following the victory, Israel has expanded it's territory by multiple sizes. It got ahold on the Golan Heights, where Syrians have been using the high ground to indiscriminately bomb Israeli civilians for years (During ""Cease fires""). It united Jerusalem, got control over the West Bank, and of course the entire Sinai.

Israel wanted to negotiate for peace and recognition, but the Arabs (Including the Arabs of Palestine) met for the Khartoum Resolution, which included No peace with Israel, No negotiation with Israel, No recognition of Israel.

Despite this, Jordan eventually gave up on their claims to the West Bank, stripping many Palestinians from their citizenship (Israel ended up offering the majority of it for the Arabs living there on multiple occasions, but all offers were rejected so far) and making peace.  
  
Egypt also gave up on their eternal war, and eventually agreed to recognize Israel and have peace with it in return of the Sinai (Minus Gaza which they did not want back).

And pretty much only Syria refused up to this day, despite offers continuing up to the 90s. And at this point today, the Golan Heights have been Israeli over 3 times the time they were Syrian.

To sum it up, this war has greatly shaped the area, and it's consequences effect us all here to this day.

Another Levi’s trademark – the ‘Two Horses’ paper patch – is rebranded with a red Jumpman logo and positioned on the tongue, featuring tan coloring that’s matched by a gum rubber outsole.

A matching yellow Jumpman badge decorates the lateral collar. Accented with faux carbon fiber detailing, the black Phylon midsole features an exposed chrome-plated chassis and springy Zoom Air units in the forefoot and heel.

1kzn102,Review- Air Jordan Retro 4- “UNDEFEATED” (2025) -LJR- From- AJ Trendy Sneakers,"
**BRIEF DESCRIPTION**

The Undefeated x Air Jordan 4 is making a highly anticipated return in 2025 to commemorate its 20th anniversary. Originally released in 2005 as the first-ever Jordan Brand collaboration, this iconic sneaker was limited to just 72 pairs, making it one of the most coveted grails in sneaker history. ￼ ￼

The 2025 retro stays true to the original military-inspired design, featuring a premium olive green suede upper with bold orange accents and black detailing. Notable features include a removable Velcro tongue patch, reminiscent of MA-1 flight jacket patches, and two heel branding options: one with the classic “Nike Air” logo and another with the “Jumpman” logo. Both versions will come in special edition packaging.  ￼ ￼

The Undefeated x Air Jordan 4 is set to release on August 28, 2025, at a retail price of $225. It will be available through Undefeated stores, Nike.com, and select retailers.  ￼ ￼

In addition to the sneakers, Jordan Brand will release an MA-1 flight jacket-inspired Air Jordan Renegade Jacket, priced at $325, along with matching apparel to complete the collection.  ￼

This re-release offers both longtime fans and new collectors a chance to own a piece of sneaker history

**REVIEW**

AJ TRENDY SNEAKERS is an amazing seller!! They went above and beyond to help me with my transaction, and the whole shipping journey, they kept me posted to be sure I knew exactly where my package was.. Hands down some of the best service I have ever gotten from a seller!! They are so polite and just GREAT!! And I’ve used many sellers, so for me to say this, means something!! Trust me when I say, they are ANAZING!! Shipping was provided through USPS , and took some time to get here, not the sellers fault at all!! I personally am ok with that, as long as they arrive and safely arrive, 2 weeks is perfect!! The seller has zero control once they ship them out, but they did update me along the way!! 

**SNEAKERS**

These GX undefeated 4s are excellent, and they are so close to a retail pair it’s insane! The over all quality is perfect!! No flaws , just an amazing sneaker!! I’ll let you decide from the photos what you think..

From the first glance, the craftsmanship feels solid—the attention to detail carries through every stitch and panel, making this pair a versatile yet bold statement piece.

👟 **Shape & Build Quality**

* **Toebox:** Well-shaped with a slightly squared profile, true to OG Jordan 4 form, with no ballooning or deformities.

* **Laces:** Comes only with **black waxed laces**, adding a premium, vintage touch for styling.
* **Inner Lining:** Soft textile with Levi’s iconic red tab print, adding a subtle branded detail.

🧼 **Comfort & Fit**

1l959hg,**\[ON-FEET REVIEW] Air Jordan 1 High x Travis Scott “Mocha” (LJR Batch) from Shoe Tim**,"**Seller:** Shoe Tim

**Batch:** LJR

**Size:** 13

**Price:** \$130 shipped

**Shipping Time:** 17 days to the EU

---

🔍 **First Impressions**

These hit hard right out the gate. That backward Swoosh never gets old — and this LJR batch delivers the Travis “Mocha” vibe *perfectly*. Suede is rich and brushable, and the sail midsole has just the right amount of vintage tint. Shape looks great in-hand and even better on foot. Definitely feels like a top-tier rep.

👟 **Shape & Build Quality**

* **Toe Box:** Slim and properly sloped. No chunky bulge or collapsing — clean profile.
* **Reverse Swoosh:** Great curve and placement. Slight overhang on the lateral edge just like retail.
* **Heel Embroidery:** Cactus Jack face is sharp and centered, not warped or oversized.
* **Collar/Wings Logo:** Nice embossing, solid ankle padding. Wings logo is crisp with correct spacing.

🎨 **Materials & Color**

* **Suede:** That mocha brown hits *perfectly* — soft to the touch with visible stroke motion. No bald spots or stiffness.
* **White Leather:** Tumbled with a natural texture. Doesn’t look plastic or overly smooth.
* **Sail Midsole:** Clean cream tone — not overly yellowed like some batches. Balances out the upper well.
* **Details:** Cactus Jack text on the medial side is faint and placed correctly. Comes with all four lace options: pink, black, red, sail.

🧼 **Comfort & Fit**

* Fits true to size (TTS)
* Classic AJ1 feel — supportive but flat. Breaks in nicely within a wear or two.
* No heel slip, padding around the collar holds the foot in well
* Great everyday comfort if you’re used to 1s

⚡ **LORE:**

The Air Jordan 1 High OG x Travis Scott “Mocha” was one of the most disruptive collabs of the 2010s. Dropped in 2019, it flipped the iconic AJ1 design with a reversed Swoosh, earthy tones, and hidden stash pockets — instantly cementing its status as a modern classic.

The Mocha colorway blends rugged utility with streetwear luxury, and Travis’s influence is felt in every detail. This sneaker helped push Jordan retros into the hands of a new wave of fans and solidified La Flame’s role in sneaker culture.

This LJR batch brings that same iconic look to life, with accurate materials, solid shape, and the same visual punch that made the retail version a grail. If you missed out, this is the next best thing — no cap.

🧠 **Final Thoughts**

LJR does numbers on this one. Shape is on point, suede feels luxe, and all the Travis details are faithfully done. For \$130 shipped, you’re getting something that punches way above its price tag. Whether it’s your first rep or a rotation mainstay, this pair absolutely earns its spot.

**Batch:** LJR

**Size:** 13

**Price:** \$130 shipped

**Shipping Time:** 17 days to the EU

---

🔍 **First Impressions**

These hit hard right out the gate. That backward Swoosh never gets old — and this LJR batch delivers the Travis “Mocha” vibe *perfectly*. Suede is rich and brushable, and the sail midsole has just the right amount of vintage tint. Shape looks great in-hand and even better on foot. Definitely feels like a top-tier rep.

👟 **Shape & Build Quality**

* **Toe Box:** Slim and properly sloped. No chunky bulge or collapsing — clean profile.
* **Reverse Swoosh:** Great curve and placement. Slight overhang on the lateral edge just like retail.
* **Heel Embroidery:** Cactus Jack face is sharp and centered, not warped or oversized.
* **Collar/Wings Logo:** Nice embossing, solid ankle padding. Wings logo is crisp with correct spacing.

🎨 **Materials & Color**

* **Suede:** That mocha brown hits *perfectly* — soft to the touch with visible stroke motion. No bald spots or stiffness.
* **White Leather:** Tumbled with a natural texture. Doesn’t look plastic or overly smooth.
* **Sail Midsole:** Clean cream tone — not overly yellowed like some batches. Balances out the upper well.
* **Details:** Cactus Jack text on the medial side is faint and placed correctly. Comes with all four lace options: pink, black, red, sail.

🧼 **Comfort & Fit**

* Fits true to size (TTS)
* Classic AJ1 feel — supportive but flat. Breaks in nicely within a wear or two.
* No heel slip, padding around the collar holds the foot in well
* Great everyday comfort if you’re used to 1s

We have received a pair of authentic ones from the factory in China ,what are your thoughts ??let's take a look first.

✅First The materials is like butter and you can get a tumble leather one this .There is no doubt that the PK factory uses premium quality materials, which makes it difficult for people to tell that it is a rep at first glance.

✅From different angles, the shape of the PK 5.0 and retail one  looks slimmer than the market batch , and the market batch looks bulky.

🔎Zooming in on the midsole, the pk 5.0 and the retail one appear to be light yellow, while the market version is darker in yellow color.

✅About the back heel ,for market batch The stitching is not even   and the fragment logo is far from the top, pk5.0 and the retail one are almost the same.

✅The sole of the market version is darker, the fragment blue of the PK and retail is more pure.

Finally, regarding tooling code, we have noticed a lot of customer feedback about font errors last year, which have been fixed in pk 5.0. I believe this version will not disappoint you.

1lmd56c,Review / Air Jordan Retro 11 “Purple Rain” From / Shoes Wholesale,"Here’s everything you need to know about the ultra‑rare Air Jordan 11 “Purple Rain” with the velvet mudguard:

⸻

👟 **Overview**

	•	This one‑of‑one sample was designed by Jordan Brand specifically for Prince, the legendary artist behind “Purple Rain,” though he unfortunately passed before seeing them  ￼.

	•	It features a deep purple suede upper and tongue, accompanied by a plush velvet mudguard that replaces the signature patent leather  ￼.

	•	A translucent purple outsole enhances the rich, regal look, while a crisp white midsole and tongue lettering provide clean contrast  ￼.

	•	Metallic silver Jumpman logo at the ankle collar boosts the luxe aesthetic  ￼.

⸻

🎨 **Special Details**

	•	The custom insoles are designed in Prince’s signature font, complete with falling rain graphics as a tribute to his iconic song “Purple Rain”  ￼.

	•	Only one pair exists, making it a true collector’s piece—it’s reportedly priced around $100,000  ￼.

⸻

💬 **Sneakerhead Response**

“This exclusive pair is the only one in existence… The deep purple upper, velvet mudguard, and silver branding elevate its premium feel.”  ￼

⸻

**In Summary**

The “Purple Rain” Air Jordan 11 stands apart as a bespoke tribute to Prince. It blends premium materials—velvet and suede—in rich purple tones, accented with metallic silver branding and custom Prince‑inspired insoles. As a one‑off sample, it isn’t available for public release and represents a pinnacle of sneaker‑and‑music culture crossover.

**REVIEW**

These sneakers really surprised me upon opening them. The quality is very good on these, and they look great!! The materials used are not cheap quality materials. The carbon fiber is real carbon fiber, and the velvet has a nice look and feel to it. I have a retail pair of the Women’s velvet 11 , and these feel almost exactly the same as that pair… the weight of the shoes feel the same as a retail pair of Jordan 11s. These even have the smell of a retail sneaker, not that glue smell that a lot of reps have. As I can only compare these to photos, considering these are a 1 of 1 sneaker, I am very pleased with these!! 

**SELLER REVIEW**

Shoes wholesale has been very good during the whole process! I told him the sneaker I wanted and he provided me with QC in less than a full day! As most sellers say they have never heard of this pair , Shoes Wholesale knew exactly what I was talking about. He shipped the shoes out immediately and showed me the shoes packaged ready to be sent , then provided the FedEx tracking number the next day.. These sneakers arrived super fast!! 7 days total!! He made me aware of where the shoes were along the way, and messaged me to ensure I received them once they arrived!! If you want excellent service and great products, I recommend this seller 100%!! He even threw in a few goodies !! Shoutout Shoes Wholesale for being a great seller!! 💪

The 2025 Air Jordan 5 Retro “Fire Red” (Black Tongue) is a highly anticipated reissue of the original 1990 colorway, set to release on September 13, 2025, in full family sizes. This edition celebrates the 35th anniversary of the Air Jordan 5 and aims to deliver a faithful recreation of the OG design. ￼ ￼

Key Features:

	•	Colorway: White/Fire Red-Black

	•	Upper: Premium white leather with side mesh netting

	•	Tongue: Black fabric tongue featuring a red Jumpman logo

	•	Accents: Fire Red details on the midsole, lace lock, and sock liner

	•	Branding: Nike Air logo embroidered on the heel

	•	Outsole: Translucent rubber outsole ￼ ￼ ￼

This release also features a refined shape with a shallower toe box and pinched heel, closely resembling the 1990 original and enhancing wearability . ￼

**REVIEW**

These sneakers are of very high quality, Y3 did a great job, and got these extremely close to Retail.

•Materials- The leather quality is very good on these

•Color- The shoes are nearly identical to a retail pair

•Tongue/Logo- The Jordan Logo is spot on to a retail pair

•Shape- The shape of the shoe is extremely close to Retail

•Overall, I would rate these a 9.5/10 and that’s only because I’ve not held a retail pair in hand yet, but from the photos I’ve seen, and comparing them to other retail Jordan 5s, I have no complaints!

**SERVICE**

Shoe Tim continues to show exceptional service! He always chooses the best sneakers from the factory, and they come flawless!! He wraps them in a plastic wrap, to ensure there is no damage upon shipping, and it helps keep the shoes from rubbing against one another.. I highly recommend giving Shoe Tim a try if you haven’t already! He communicates very well, and has compassion about what he does, If you don’t like the sneakers he simply returns them until your satisfied(This is yet to happen for me) because the shoes he chooses are perfect!

1l9pp00,REVIEW / On Foot / Air Jordan / Retro 5 / Fire Red “Black tongue” / Y3 🔥/ From - Shoe Tim,"After Wearing this pair several times, I felt it’s time to do an on foot review… I will say , Y3 has performed very well!! They are extremely comfortable, and probably one of my newest favorite pair of sneakers! I am so happy with this purchase from Shoe Tim! Let’s get into it… 

**Materials:**. The leather quality on these is fantastic, premium, and soft, but does not crease.

•Tongue- great material, feels good

•Side cage- very good , feels premium 

• Leather- very soft , doesn’t crease 

•Lace lock- Heavy duty, same as retail 

**Comfort** These are the most comfortable pair of Jordan Retro 5s I have ever put on my feet, can wear all day without any issues , or feet hurting!

**Sizing** These are TTS , fit my feet very well!

**Details** I haven’t had a Retail pair in hands, but they look very good! 
  
•Side cage- placed well , like retail

•Tongue- Jordan sign is good, Thick tongue , 

• Color- Colors look good, same as retail

• Shape- Over all shape looks good , close to retail



**OVERALL**  I will rate this pair a 9.5/ 10 , and the only reason they aren’t getting a 10, is because I haven’t had a retail pair to compare them to, I will say I haven’t LJR Jordan 5s, and the Y3 feels much better on my feet, the quality is just crazy good! If you have questioned yourself on whether or not Y3 is a good choice, I 100% will buy more Y3 version Jordan Retro 5s… I took photos in different lighting so hopefully you can see what I see in person, Unfortunately you can’t feel what I feel on foot, but it’s Wonderful!! No exaggeration, Extremely Comfortable!!

1ldqxws,'F1' Review Thread,"I will continue to update this post as reviews come in.

[**Rotten Tomatoes:**](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/f1_the_movie) Certified Fresh

**Critics Consensus:** Driven by Brad Pitt's laidback magnetism and sporting a souped-up engine courtesy of Joseph Kosinski's kinetic direction, *F1 The Movie* brings vintage cool across the finish line.

|Critics|Score|**Number of Reviews**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**All Critics**|83%|242|
|**Top Critics**|81%|57|

[**Metacritic:**](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/f1-the-movie/) 68 (49 Reviews)

**Sample Reviews:**

Peter Rainer, Christian Science Monitor - Their stated aim was to make the most authentic racing car movie ever made and, from a purely technical standpoint, they’ve succeeded. **3.5/5**

Peter Howell, Toronto Star - “F1” is mostly an enjoyable experience, especially when viewed on an IMAX screen -- practically mandatory with a film like this. With a running time exceeding 2.5 hours, though, your eyes and brain are both likely to feel the burn. **3/4**

Alison Willmore, New York Magazine/Vulture - The world, with all its messy commercial demands, is always present, and ultimately, F1 is just another product of those pressures — nothing more.

Christina Newland, [iNews.co.uk](http://iNews.co.uk) \- F1 uses old-fashioned, engine-revving storytelling. **4/5**

Anupama Chopra, The Hollywood Reporter - Big, noisy, obvious and hugely entertaining

Mark Kermode, Kermode and Mayo's Take (YouTube) - It's Brad Pitt goes fast and then smiles at you in a slightly cheeky way. It's the very definition of a bucket of popcorn movie. See it in on a huge big screen.

Kyle Smith, Wall Street Journal - Mr. Bruckheimer’s style has endured for a reason: It’s entertaining. Doom and gloom may be fine for the Oscar pictures that emerge tearfully in the fall, but summer is a great time for some vroom and zoom.

Bob Mondello, NPR - Brad Pitt's in the driver's seat, there are fresh camera tricks designed to put you in the car with him, and there's definitely a formula, delivered by folks who know how to make it pop and sizzle.

Adam Nayman, The Ringer - Nobody is expecting a studio tentpole production that cost $300 million (or whatever) to be a subversive critique of late capitalism, but the movie is ultimately so deferential toward the sport and its ruling class that it comes off as kowtowing.

Barry Hertz, Globe and Mail - Nothing is exactly new in F1, yet at the same time it is all immensely, rewardingly renewable -- a true blue box of recycled cinematic trash, compacted into something irresistibly bright and shiny.

Katie Walsh, Tribune News Service - With Kosinski at the wheel, “F1” should be Pitt’s “Top Gun: Maverick,” but this land-bound racing film never takes flight, despite all the onscreen horsepower. **2/4**

Manohla Dargis, New York Times - F1 is very simply about the satisfactions of genre cinema and the pleasures of watching appealing characters navigate fast, exotic cars that whine like juiced-up mosquitoes.

Richard Whittaker, Austin Chronicle - F1 is like KISS. It’s very good at what it does, but what it does is just being spectacular in a conventional, predictable way. **2/5**

Amy Nicholson, Los Angeles Times - The pleasures of “F1” are engineered to bypass the brain. It’s muscular and thrilling and zippy, even though at over two-and-a-half hours long, it has a toy dump truck’s worth of plot.

Alonso Duralde, The Film Verdict - The film equivalent of a Waymo, a ride that’s all car and no human being.

Nell Minow, [RogerEbert.com](http://RogerEbert.com) \- “F1” is exactly what summer blockbusters are supposed to be, exciting, romantic, funny, glamorous, and purely entertaining. **B+**

Kristen Lopez, The Film Maven (Substack) - It’s not that F1 is a bad movie, just a painfully silly one, and that can work if it’s what you’re seeking. On its own it’s a stock race car movie whose magnetic visuals do a lot to help an uninspired story. **C-**

Robert Daniels, [RogerEbert.com](http://RogerEbert.com) \- Though “F1” has little to say about the sport’s past, present, or future, the propulsive ride it engineers isn’t a wasted diversion. **2.5/4**

Moira MacDonald, Seattle Times - This movie is entirely about the driving, and the speed. **3/4**

Ann Hornaday, Washington Post - It’s a plot as old as the horseless carriage, but in “F1,” it’s fuel-injected by an exceptionally appealing cast. **3/4**

Rafer Guzman, Newsday - A seductive fantasy built around cool cars and an even cooler Brad Pitt. **3/4**

Randy Myers, San Jose Mercury News - No doubt this is one mighty familiar story, but who gives a damn when it’s told with such energy and skill. **3/4**

Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune - In an artfully packaged movie offering more teamwork lessons per lap than any racing film before it, nothing in “F1” beats those pit stops — purely cinematic blurs of speed, noise and collaborative purpose. **2.5/4**

Donald Clarke, Irish Times - Without cliches ... narrative art would have withered away before the ancient Greeks got into their stride. But F1 really is too thuddingly familiar for words. Drop a bowling ball off a cliff and you would be less sure of its trajectory. **3/5**

Danny Leigh, Financial Times - Kosinski has found some rhymes between blockbuster movie making and Formula 1: another epic spectacle reliant on teamwork, rare talents and a vast stack of cash. **4/5**

Matt Singer, ScreenCrush - Old fashioned in the best ways. **7/10**

Esther Zuckerman, Bloomberg News - It’s not as if F1 bucks sports movie conventions; it just executes them, for the most part, extremely well.

Maxwell Rabb, Chicago Reader - Following a dramatic and expertly executed crash sequence, the movie loses its grip. It veers off course into a montage that speeds past where most of the character development might’ve taken place.

Cary Darling, Houston Chronicle - In what's turning into a long, hot summer full of unnerving news in the wider world, ""F1: The Movie"" offers a refuge of air-conditioned escapism. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. **3.5/5**

Stephanie Zacharek, TIME Magazine - Brad Pitt, at 61, has finally aged into roles like these. And sometimes, as F1 proves, they’re the best thing that can happen to a guy.

Stephen Romei, The Australian - There have been better motor racing movies -- including Michael Mann’s recent Ferrari -- but F1 has its thrilling moments, and its 156-minute run time goes by almost as fast as Hayes drives. **3/5**

Justin Chang, The New Yorker - Again and again, “F1” finds fresh pathways into familiar material; it keeps its surface-level moves unpredictable even though its overarching trajectory isn’t.

Jake Wilson, The Age (Australia) - “Thrilling” and “lulling” can be oddly close together, and that’s how it feels watching the cars speed round and round the track in the skilfully made if somewhat monotonous F1. **3/5**

Wenlei Ma, The Nightly (AU) - F1 is super entertaining and mostly a bloody good time, it comes with a lot of buts, caveats and howevers. **3/5**

Philip De Semlyen, Time Out - Switch off your brain and F1 will overwhelm your senses with spectacle, sonics and just enough human drama to hold it all together. **4/5**

Johnny Oleksinski, New York Post - The races look real, breathtakingly so, and are edited like a bat out of hell. Most importantly, the viewer fully believes Pitt and Idris are actually driving these cars. **3.5/4**

Jake Coyle, Associated Press - A fine-tuned machine of a movie that, in its most riveting racing scenes, approaches a kind of high-speed splendor. **3/4**

Michael Ordoña, San Francisco Chronicle - Pitt’s screen presence has aged like a leather jacket, scuffed in all the right places and cooler than ever. **2.5/4**

Sophie Butcher, Empire Magazine - Joseph Kosinski has done it again. F1 combines unparalleled access, pioneering filmmaking and moving redemption arcs to deliver an exhilarating cinematic experience. What will he attach a camera to next? **4/5**

Nicholas Barber, [BBC.com](http://BBC.com) \- While Top Gun: Maverick was a masterpiece that pulled viewers into events in and out of the cockpit, F1 is simply a competently assembled collection of underdog sports-drama clichés. It never convinces you that its protagonists are human beings. **2/5**

Tim Grierson, Screen International - Top Gun: Maverick director Joseph Kosinski does for cars what he previously did for fighter jets, transforming them into balletic machines that fly through the frame with unstoppable propulsion.

Peter Bradshaw, Guardian - There’s a fair bit of macho silliness here, but the panache with which director Joseph Kosinski puts it together is very entertaining. Condon is a vital fuel ingredient and to a F1 non-believer like me, the result is surreal and spectacular. **4/5**

Linda Marric, HeyUGuys - F1 The Movie is a high-octane spectacle with heart, humour, and heroism. It'll dominate the summer blockbuster track with the same adrenaline, charisma, and pulse-pounding action that defines Formula One itself. The very definition of a crowd-pleaser. **5/5**

Adam Woodward, Little White Lies - If you’re look­ing for a seri­ous win­dow into the high-stakes, cut­throat world of For­mu­la One, you cer­tain­ly won’t find it here. So stick on that Fleet­wood Mac CD, grab those vin­tage Dun­hill avi­a­tors, and strap your­self in. **4/5**

Clarisse Loughrey, Independent (UK) - While director Joseph Kosinski and cinematographer Claudio Miranda can certainly shoot cars as well as they can planes, F1 represents the spiritually bone-dry, abrasive inverse to all of Maverick’s giddy pleasures. **2/5**

Lovia Gyarkye, The Hollywood Reporter - A deft addition to a sturdy lineage of motorsport flicks, from Rush and Gran Turismo to Ford v Ferrari and, most recently, Ferrari.

Brian Truitt, USA Today - Watching Pitt burn this much rubber, and with macho panache, puts ""F1"" in the winners' circle. **3/4**

David Fear, Rolling Stone - This what blockbusters used to look like. Come for the most impressive, lustrous car that a gajillion-dollar budget can buy. The reason to stay, however, is the driver.

Owen Gleiberman, Variety - We go into “F1” excited about being excited, and the film makes good on that. It’s nothing if not an adrenaline high. Yet it’s a high that may leave you feeling a bit empty afterwards.

David Ehrlich, IndieWire - Always entertaining for how effectively it welds hyper-modern spectacle to the chassis of a classic underdog story... but in working so hard to satisfy newbies and experts at the same time that it often struggles to seize on its simplest pleasures. **C+**

Jordan Hoffman, Entertainment Weekly - 'F1' has no peer in its dedication to speed, movement, and visceral excitement. **B**

William Bibbiani, TheWrap  - An incredibly sterile film about virility. It’s so manly it can barely perform.

Robbie Collin, Daily Telegraph (UK) - It’s a film which understands the pleasure of seeing familiar roads driven with consummate expertise. The F does stand for formula, after all. **4/5**

Kevin Maher, The Times (UK) - There’s an unashamedly “enthusiastic” cross-promotional quality to the film, like a two-and-a-half-hour Formula 1 commercial, that never quite gels with its hoary central story. **2/5**

Liz Shannon Miller, Consequence - While Tom Cruise did already his big race car movie back in 1990, it’s easy to imagine him watching F1 and seething with jealousy. Because the racing sequences look like they were as thrilling to shoot as they are to watch. **B+**

Nick Schager, The Daily Beast - An old-school Jerry Bruckheimer-produced spectacular, albeit one that never deviates from a familiar summer blockbuster course and, consequently, fails to truly kick into adrenalized overdrive.

Jake Cole, Slant Magazine - F1 succeeds for many of the same reasons that Top Gun: Maverick does: for elevating familiar material with old-school filmmaking swagger. **3/4**

**SYNOPSIS:**

Dubbed “the greatest that never was,” Sonny Hayes (Brad Pitt) was FORMULA 1’s most promising phenom of the 1990s until an accident on the track nearly ended his career. Thirty years later, he’s a nomadic racer-for-hire when he’s approached by his former teammate Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem), owner of a struggling FORMULA 1 team that is on the verge of collapse. Ruben convinces Sonny to come back to FORMULA 1 for one last shot at saving the team and being the best in the world. He’ll drive alongside Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris), the team's hotshot rookie intent on setting his own pace. But as the engines roar, Sonny’s past catches up with him and he finds that in FORMULA 1, your teammate is your fiercest competition—and the road to redemption is not something you can travel alone.

[**Rotten Tomatoes:**](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/f1_the_movie) Certified Fresh

**Critics Consensus:** Driven by Brad Pitt's laidback magnetism and sporting a souped-up engine courtesy of Joseph Kosinski's kinetic direction, *F1 The Movie* brings vintage cool across the finish line.

**Sample Reviews:**

Peter Rainer, Christian Science Monitor - Their stated aim was to make the most authentic racing car movie ever made and, from a purely technical standpoint, they’ve succeeded. **3.5/5**

Peter Howell, Toronto Star - “F1” is mostly an enjoyable experience, especially when viewed on an IMAX screen -- practically mandatory with a film like this. With a running time exceeding 2.5 hours, though, your eyes and brain are both likely to feel the burn. **3/4**

Alison Willmore, New York Magazine/Vulture - The world, with all its messy commercial demands, is always present, and ultimately, F1 is just another product of those pressures — nothing more.

Christina Newland, [iNews.co.uk](http://iNews.co.uk) \- F1 uses old-fashioned, engine-revving storytelling. **4/5**

Anupama Chopra, The Hollywood Reporter - Big, noisy, obvious and hugely entertaining

Mark Kermode, Kermode and Mayo's Take (YouTube) - It's Brad Pitt goes fast and then smiles at you in a slightly cheeky way. It's the very definition of a bucket of popcorn movie. See it in on a huge big screen.

Kyle Smith, Wall Street Journal - Mr. Bruckheimer’s style has endured for a reason: It’s entertaining. Doom and gloom may be fine for the Oscar pictures that emerge tearfully in the fall, but summer is a great time for some vroom and zoom.

Bob Mondello, NPR - Brad Pitt's in the driver's seat, there are fresh camera tricks designed to put you in the car with him, and there's definitely a formula, delivered by folks who know how to make it pop and sizzle.

Adam Nayman, The Ringer - Nobody is expecting a studio tentpole production that cost $300 million (or whatever) to be a subversive critique of late capitalism, but the movie is ultimately so deferential toward the sport and its ruling class that it comes off as kowtowing.

Barry Hertz, Globe and Mail - Nothing is exactly new in F1, yet at the same time it is all immensely, rewardingly renewable -- a true blue box of recycled cinematic trash, compacted into something irresistibly bright and shiny.

Katie Walsh, Tribune News Service - With Kosinski at the wheel, “F1” should be Pitt’s “Top Gun: Maverick,” but this land-bound racing film never takes flight, despite all the onscreen horsepower. **2/4**

Manohla Dargis, New York Times - F1 is very simply about the satisfactions of genre cinema and the pleasures of watching appealing characters navigate fast, exotic cars that whine like juiced-up mosquitoes.

Richard Whittaker, Austin Chronicle - F1 is like KISS. It’s very good at what it does, but what it does is just being spectacular in a conventional, predictable way. **2/5**

Amy Nicholson, Los Angeles Times - The pleasures of “F1” are engineered to bypass the brain. It’s muscular and thrilling and zippy, even though at over two-and-a-half hours long, it has a toy dump truck’s worth of plot.

Alonso Duralde, The Film Verdict - The film equivalent of a Waymo, a ride that’s all car and no human being.

Nell Minow, [RogerEbert.com](http://RogerEbert.com) \- “F1” is exactly what summer blockbusters are supposed to be, exciting, romantic, funny, glamorous, and purely entertaining. **B+**

Kristen Lopez, The Film Maven (Substack) - It’s not that F1 is a bad movie, just a painfully silly one, and that can work if it’s what you’re seeking. On its own it’s a stock race car movie whose magnetic visuals do a lot to help an uninspired story. **C-**

Robert Daniels, [RogerEbert.com](http://RogerEbert.com) \- Though “F1” has little to say about the sport’s past, present, or future, the propulsive ride it engineers isn’t a wasted diversion. **2.5/4**

Story has it that this was the day Pac was introduced to his bodyguard Frank Alexander's niece, Lemika Early! 🔥 Lemika was the victim of a tragic car crash that left her confined to a wheelchair and paralyzed from the waist down. It’s said when Pac heard about Lemika’s story, he invited her out to California to meet and spend the day with him! 📸 These pics are from that day on the set of the movie Gridlock’d that Pac starred in.

Pac took Lemika and her people to a studio session where he would go on to record “Why U Turn On Me” and “Reincarnation,” which Pac actually let Lemika lay down an outro for! 🎶🎤

Pac also took Lemika and her family to the mall and bought her a 1996 Kevin Garnett Champion Jersey 🔥. It’s said he did that to give her something to match the kicks he bought her!

1ll5gpe,"Bought Defective AIR MAX 95s– No Real Support, No Exchange, and a Joke of a Compensation","I just want to share my extremely frustrating experience with Nike. I bought a pair of shoes for 500 AED off the nike app, and they turned out to be defective — clearly a quality control issue. I reached out to Nike support expecting a reasonable resolution, but all they offered was either an exchange or a small discount.

Here’s the problem:
	•	The shoes were out of stock, so I couldn’t even exchange them.
	•	They offered me a mere 10% discount (that’s just 100 AED) as compensation for a completely defective product.
	•	I explained that returning the shoes would be a hassle and that I wasn’t looking for store credit. I simply wanted a fair solution either a proper refund or at least 50% compensation.

After that? Complete silence. Thats the best they could ( get me to spend more money )

Honestly, for a brand that charges premium prices and claims to care about its customers, this is seriously disappointing. I’ve spent years buying Nike, but after this experience, I don’t think I ever will again.

1l6mlzv,Air Max 1’s are the most uncomfortable shoe I’ve bought in the last ten years.,"Visiting my sister in New York City. Forgot my Hoka Clifton 9’s, so I ended up only having my Nike Air Max 1’s to walk all over the city with. 

Let me preface this with yes, I know that generally speaking the Air Max 1 these days is more of a fashion shoe than a comfort one. Also, I had a pair of Air Max back in the early aughts that was really comfortable and cushy. But it’s still a brand new shoe, from one of the biggest companies on earth, and it’s *supposedly* got a giant air bag on the heel for comfort while walking. 

Let me tell you, I just walked probably 5-7 miles, throughout the city, and the balls of my feet are a freaking wreck. I honestly feel like I was wearing dress shoes or no shoes at all. 

I’m absolutely baffled at just how uncomfortable a supposed walking/running shoe can be. I know the Air Max tech is old, but I have to believe that Nike can improve the foam and therefore, the ride. They must just not give a shit. 

This 100% gives me pause on buying *anything* Nike ever again.

My second purchase with RepMaster via HooBuy. RM was easy to communicate with and answered any questions. They would have arrived quicker if I bought directly through him. Top bloke producing the goods! 

I finally have one of my all time favourite sneaks. The materials are unreal, real texture, amazing attention to detail even with the Velcro and just a  stunning pair. There is a tint of yellow on the midsole but not sure how much this varies with the retail pair. 

Thank you dogs for your support! This was my third purchase just over a month and there’s many more to come 🥳

📬 Delivered: June 25 (6 days total) 🇺🇸 USA
👤 Agent: Rapmaster
👟 Pairs Ordered:
	•	Dior B30 Black/White (A+ Batch)
	•	Off-White x Air Max 90 “The Ten” (White) – OWF Batch
	•	Nike Air Force 1 Triple White – GX Batch

⸻

🏁 Overall Experience

First time ordering from Rapmaster. Communication was solid, QC came fast, shipping was smooth (only 6 days). I’ll definitely be using him again if consistency stays like this.

⸻

🔥 Off-White x Air Max 90 “The Ten” (White) – OWF Batch

✅ Pros:
	•	Shape: Clean overall silhouette. Toe box and midsole match retail well.
	•	Medial Text: Sharp, aligned, good font weight.
	•	Swoosh: Accurate shape and clean stitching.
	•	“AIR” Text: Good font, spacing, no bleeding.
	•	Zip Tie: Correct placement + matte finish.
	•	Tongue: Right height, exposed foam checks out.
	•	Heel Tabs: Symmetrical logo/stitching.

❌ Cons:
	•	Toe box is puffier than retail 
	•	Heel is slightly higher than retail shape.
	•	Outsole texture stars may be a bit sharp.
	•	Foam on tongue cut too clean. 

🎯 Final Verdict: 9/10
OWF batch delivers. On-foot? You’re not getting called out.

⸻

👑 Christian Dior B30 (A+ Batch)

✅ Pros:
	•	3M CD logo: Reflective, sharp, great angle/size.
	•	Toe Box: Slim like retail, not chunky.
	•	Midsole/Outsole: Proper gloss and texture.
	•	Tongue/Laces: Crisp embossing, tight quality laces.
	•	Insole Branding: On point — clean stitch work.
	•	Packaging: Came with dust bag, Dior wrap, branded box.

❌ Cons (Minor):
	•	Slightly more curve at heel than retail.
	•	Midsole may be 1–2mm thicker in spots.
	•	Came with generic shoe tree (not Dior shaped).

🎯 Final Verdict: 9.5/10
Insanely close to retail.

⸻

🧼 Nike Air Force 1 Triple White – GX Batch

✅ Pros:
	•	Heel Nike AIR stitching is clean + even.
	•	Leather feels right — light tumbled grain.
	•	Toe box isn’t bulky — great shape.
	•	Perforation + outsole texture match retail.
	•	Interior padding, tongue tag, and sizing all check out.

🎯 Final Verdict: 9.3/10
Another solid GX pair. Easy everyday wear, passes the eye test.

⸻

TL;DR – Rapmaster legit. QC was accurate, shipping was fast, all 3 pairs slapped.
GX and A+ batches delivered the way reps should. Will definitely run it back again.

### What just happened isn’t just “wrong” it’s **illegal** and **dangerous**.

Brad Lander wasn’t resisting.  
He wasn’t rioting.  
He wasn’t breaking anything.

He was exercising the rights that every American is *supposed* to have:  
- Ask for a warrant  
- Stand beside a neighbor  
- Question a badge

> **If the government can arrest an elected official for that, no one is safe.**

---

### This is what fascism looks like:

- **Mask-wearing agents** dragging people out of court  
- **No warrants. No IDs. No oversight.**  
- **Political officials arrested for doing the right thing**

And don’t forget this didn’t happen in some distant border town.  
It happened in **Manhattan.** At an **immigration court.** On U.S. soil. In broad daylight.

### What You Can Do:

**Share this story** before it disappears from the news cycle  
**Demand accountability**: call your reps & demand a congressional ICE investigation

If they can do this to an elected official, they can do it to anyone. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, a sitting government official and mayoral candidate was just **arrested by masked federal agents** at **26 Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan**.

His “crime”?  
Standing next to a dismissed immigrant case.  
Asking to see a **warrant**.  
Linking arms with a human being targeted by ICE.

1lgtxrl,"Our daughter said that my partner (28F) is her mother, and I (27F) am not. My partner said she just told her the truth, and it doesn't matter, but why would she say something like this, and how do I deal with it?","My partner and I have been together for nine years. It isn't legally recognised to be married where we live, but we would be if we could. I know some people would assume we have commitment issues or something like that, but that's the way it is. We have two daughters. One is four, and the other is six months old.

Biologically, they are completely hers. Other than the donor. We do not know their identity, but our children can request it as adults. We had it done in a neighbouring country, because they are hesitant about doing it for people in our situation here. I love children, but I didn't want to be pregnant, and it's a very long process. She did want to, so it worked out well.

I am in the post graduate stage at the moment of being a doctor. It's what I've always wanted, and it's important to me that we are in the position where our children can do whatever they want in the future as well. I also really enjoy it, it's interesting, and while it's a lot of work, it's worth it to me.

I do try to help and spend as much time with the children as I can. It can be hard though because of the hours I have to work. Some of my colleagues are more understanding, I am lucky to work in quite a modern place, so I do get better hours most of the time, but it still isn't ideal.

I try to at least help either every morning or evening, I bath them, I dress them, I read to them, I play with them, I take them places, I really do try to be as present as possible. I don't want to be the parent who's always working. I also try to help my partner obviously, I clean, I cook meals, I do those sorts of things as well.

About a week ago, I was putting our older daughter to bed. She said, why is my partner (I will use that because she calls us both different names, which is both personal and it would get confusing) with you, and not my father. I said that we have talked about this. And she said yes, and my partner had said to her I'm not her mother, and she is. And that she doesn't understand why my partner was weird and was with me and not her father.

Obviously, children can get confused. So I talked to my partner and asked why our daughter said this, and why she thought this. We have discussed with her before when she has asked how it works, why she has two mothers, and it never involved who was the 'real' mother. She knows my partner gave birth to her, she's seen photos of her pregnant and things like that,  but she's little, she doesn't really understand what that means.

My partner said she had just told her the truth when she had asked, and I asked why. She said that we can't lie and act like we're the same because we're not, and it's only going to confuse her. I said that she's not confused, that her 'father' is irrelevant in this because he's not her father, and all she did was centre everything around her and act like I don't matter.

She said I'm making it into something significant when it's not, and that she did far more than I have ever done, and that neither of our children would be here without her. And that's true. But it feels like she doesn't care about everything I have done, and the worst thing for me is that she would tell our child these sorts of things. It really upsets me that now, she might see as different, and that's all because of what she said to her. 

I don't know why she suddenly thinks so differently to me, when we never had this before. Maybe there's something I can't see, maybe something is wrong, I don't know, but I didn't think there was.

1lf0wh2,Do I (27f) just accept that my fiancé (35m) can only pay a small portion of the bills and not question it?,"TLDR: My fiancé gets angry when i talk about money, currently we need to move to a bigger place for his daughter and he refuses to pay 50/50. Do I just accept that he can only pay a small portion of the bills and not question it despite his good income?

For context:

My fiancé and I have lived together for five months now. Currently I pay a majority of the bills about 70/30. Which I agreed to as this was my apartment first and was supposed to be temporary until we found a bigger place. (The plan was to split bills 50/50 when we moved). We are at a point now that we really need a bigger place. He has a daughter we have on the weekends and currently she is sleeping in the living room. 

When I asked him how much he can afford in rent he told me $600 a month TOTAL for his half of rent/electricity/Wi-Fi. He makes $65k annually usd, and has minimal other bills. Also prior to moving in with me, he paid $1100 a month in rent alone. So I’m not sure why now he can only afford $600. 

A few times now, I have asked him to sit down  with me and create a budget. As he makes enough money to pay more than $600 a month in bills. And quite frankly that won’t even cover half the rent for a 2 bedroom apartment in my city much less the added costs of utilities and WiFi. Every time this happens, he gets angry, yells at me accusing me of being judgmental when it comes to money and storms off. When truly all I care about is making sure that we get a bigger place with a room for his daughter. He refuses to make a budget and says that it’s unnecessary and that he’s a grown man who has never had to have one. 

At this point, I believe he just expects me to shoulder paying more in bills and I feel a little used. I do make more money but not by much (75k usd). I’m just not sure what to do at this point do I just accept the amount he gave me and not question it? However, that puts me in a situation where I’m paying a majority of the bills, which I don’t feel is fair.

Apple swore off cocaine forever after a night of listening to him brag: ""Every addict should just get locked in a private movie theatre with Q.T. & Paul Thomas Anderson on coke, and they’ll never want to do it again.""","Apple looked back on the years of her life characterized by drug and alcohol abuse, including one wild night at the home of Quentin Tarantino. Apple was then dating filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson, whom she began seeing in 1997, and with whom she shared a tumultuous, drug-fueled three years. Apple recalled the “one excruciating night” at Tarantino’s home that caused her to swear off cocaine forever, wherein she spent the night listening to Anderson and Tarantino brag.

“Every addict should just get locked in a private movie theatre with Q.T. and P.T.A. on coke, and they’ll never want to do it again,” Apple joked.

Apple went on to describe her relationship with Anderson, who directed music videos for her songs, while she wrote a wrap for his film *Magnolia*. Though their partnership was creatively collaborative, Apple remembers their relationship as “painful and chaotic,” characterized by criticism and contempt. Apple described Anderson’s temper, recalling how he threw a chair across the room after the 1998 Academy Awards, where *Boogie Nights* lost Best Original Screenplay. Apple recalled thinking, “Fuck this, this is not a good relationship.” Apple also remembered another incident where Anderson shoved her out of his car and onto the sidewalk. Anderson declined to comment to *The New Yorker* through his agent.

1lg8gqx,Its fine if Kids like the show just PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BRING YOUR CHILDREN TO CONS!,"
Bringing your kid to a *Helluva Boss* or *Hazbin Hotel* convention isn’t cute or cool — it just makes things awkward for the cast. I’ve seen people get mad because a cast member made a sex joke in response to a kid’s question, but honestly, what do you expect? The joke was tame, too. All they said was, “Blitzø’s favorite animal is one he can ride,” followed by, “It’s NOT a horse! 😏” They could’ve said much worse.

The point is, if you’re going to be offended by adult humor, don’t bring your kid to an adult-themed convention. It’s that simple.
I mean if your kid is a fan of the show that's fine, I mean you can't stop kids from like it. I liked south park when I was 7 I can't be talking.

They can clearly write romance as indicated by lots of people liking Parvatis romance quest. But they will NOT do it for players at all cost if they can help it.  
  
The biggest reason I have ever been given is they “don't feel the can deliver a good quality romance and thus decide not to do it it” when I cant help but point out that them not being perfect has never prevented them from including lots of other mechanics.

I play their games often in SPITE of their numerous weird if not outright bad gameplay mechanics.

But for some reason they can include those no matter how haphazardly they cobbled them together, but romance? Nah that they wont do cause they cant make it “good enough” apparently?

Which, gonna be real, they are never gonna get better or improve in their romance writing if they just never tackle it.

Straight up, I want romances in my RPGs games okay? In particular if you make companions a big deal, as they tend to do, it feels outright strange to me how adamantly they refuse to just let us romance them no matter what. I know I am not alone in this. People LOVE themselves an RPG romance. But for some reason every time people point out Obsidian refuses to do them it goes “oh, that is just how they are” as if this is some minor quirk.

Which, fair enough if it is for you, but I loved a LOT of RPGs for their romances. I would have still probably enjoyed Blauds Gate 3 without the several amazing romance options, but significantly less so.

And to some degree I gotta think if the reasoning REALLY is this “I don’t wanna under deliver” mindset in regard to it, I cant help but think that not doing it AT ALL is not much of an improvement.

Especially since again, they in my mind HAVE shown they can do romance, but just refuse to let players be the one who participate in them rather than just the companions and NPCs.

1lcgz9e,Why do people keep dismissing this game by saying it's just a copy of Poppy Playtime ?,"Seriously, I want to understand that criticism because the only thing I see that are similar are :

1. You walk around in an abandoned area

2. You get chased by ennemies

3. It's a free roam 3d game

4. There are cardboard cutouts which make noises

5. There are puzzles for you to solve

  
But when you actually look at the differences, you can see that :

1. This game emphasises exploration by letting you explore a building and even backtrack to certain areas with a realistic layout and shortcuts that can even lead you to optional secret areas, instead of going from just point A to point B.

2. The stealth sections are a lot more creative with them having only one enemy that can appear in any costume, blending well with the different areas. They also vary in how you have to progress through them in the game, for example by either gathering missing pieces or animatronic parts.

3. The gameplay also varies with different and creative chase sequences like with Big top and Dollie.

4. You have collectables which lets you achieve a secret ending with an unique inventory system.

5. The puzzles are still very different and unique from the ones in Poppy playtime.

5. There's still supernatural elements in this game, like with the Tiger rock costume seemingly being haunted chasing you in the basement section.

1lhw1r3,"What deck archetype do you just not quite understand the appeal of, but want to see why people enjoy it? I'll start with mine, would love to hear what people see in it. Let's learn about some decks we wouldn't usually play!","For me, it's definitely Voltron. I've never really understood the appeal of a deck that overcommits to a single creature. Even if it doesn't just immediately get sniped by removal, it feels like most Voltron builds just piss off one player by killing them early, maybe get a second guy if they're lucky, and then die to the third player who had time to build or combo and got to save their removal. That play pattern seems pretty consistent with every Voltron deck I've played against, and kingmaker turbo just doesn't seem appealing to me.

So what's the secret for you Voltron players? Are you hiding some ace up your sleeve that wins consistently but I never seem to see? Is it just the fantasy of smacking someone with a really big guy with 20 swords stapled onto them? Do you just really like Bogles in 60 card and want to play it in EDH?

1lme1so,My girlfriend just admitted to me that her mom wants us to break up and said she might do it. What should I do?,"I was talking with my girlfriend earlier today and she mentioned that her mom has been hinting for her to break up with me. It didn't seem too bad, maybe stung a little because I thought her mom liked me, until I asked what she would do if her mom tried to make her do it. 

Unfortunately, she told me she would. She said she didn't know at first and then started saying she values her mom's opinion a lot and then devolved into saying she probably would. She said she'd want to stay friends and I told her I wouldn't be able to do that if she went through with breaking up with me because her mom asked.

She's an adult and can make her own decisions, so if she did decide to do it, it would 100% be her own choice. I understand she loves her mom and it's a hard decision, but it's still really upsetting to me. I told her I wouldn't talk to her if she did that and now she's upset and her tone is way off. 

What should I do? I don't want to break up with her, but I'm scared that her mom telling her to do so is just around the corner.

Edit to add: I didn't include our ages because I don't want her finding this and getting upset, but I'll say the ages in comments if someone asks so it's not in the actual story if this somehow goes viral on Tikok or something.

Edit to add: here are some details that people keep asking for, we are both around 18 in age, we're long distance, we've been together for about 2 years, her mom wants us to break up because she's thinks she wont take risks or make friends in college if she's taken, and she values her moms opinion a lot because they're close to each other (that's what she says, but her mom is incredibly toxic and narcissistic so I think it's trauma bonding)

Update: we broke up. We tried to talk it through and i tried to tell her that what her mom is doing is wrong and that she needs to make her own decision, and she couldn't. She doesn't want to make her mom mad, but she still wants to be with me. We decided to try and compromise and just go on a break instead of fully breaking up. We're gonna try to be friends until she's out of college or until her mom doesn't care anymore so we can possibly give things another shot. Thank you to everyone who gave advice and encouraging words. I'm feeling really bad at the moment and I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to get over this.

Update two: We're going to try to stay together. She said she didn't want to do it this way let alone at all and that she wanted to wait until she absolutely had to to see if she could change her moms mind and to try and spend our last few weeks in normalcy. So thats what we're going to try and do. We're gonna pretend none of this happened and try to treasure our last bit of time together before summer ends and then we're going to try and stay friends until her mom changes her mind or until she's done with college. We both really love each other and both really want to stay together, but she cant find any other solutions other than trying to say no to her mom but she cant bring herself to do it because she's afraid.

Update 3: I talked through things with my friend and they gave me the push I really needed. I mentioned how there are plenty of signs that my gf is already checked out of the relationship and has been and they pointed it out to me. They helped me write out a wall of text to tell her we need to break up and told me they'd be there for me when it's all over. I'll be sending the text to her later today when she's not busy.

1lb41zi,Nike Panda Dunks for sale 4.5k bit nego,"Got the permission from mod team to post this ad 

Last year i bought nike panda dunks from veg non veg but messed up in size got a uk7 whereas i wear uk8 (normally i wear uk7 in nike airforce's so i thought the sizing would be same for dunks too but not). Couldn't exchange or return because veg non veg does not provide return or exchange.

these panda dunks are uk7 and condition is almost new no creases at all you can see it in pictures got bill box and everything so the buyer can verify the authenticity of the shoe itself.

The shoe is not for much use to me because my foot hurt wearing them and thats why just wore it like 2-3times at max

1l2rijw,I absolutely HATE Adam Silvers direction for the identity of the league,"Off the bat this post has nothing to do with actual basketball so if you’re here for that sorry lol. This is a rant about how bland Adam Silver is making the league

1 - The corporate logos
The Orlando Magic Logo was the tipping point for me today, a team that’s had nothing but hits and now they’re stuck with the same boring basketball in circle with rounded text logo that every other rebrand seems to follow (Jerseys are fire though), Hawks, 76ers, Nuggets, Twolves are other teams who all had much better logos before and now have identical logo silhouettes

2 - The lack of occasion
The Finals and the Playoffs used to actually look like the finals and the playoffs, I don’t even mean bring back the huge Larry logo like in 2008 but just bring back the small logos at least to signify this is in fact a playoff game, the same goes for the jerseys, bring back the nba finals patch, it looks so much better, not to mention YouTube TVs terrible finals logo, just keep the 2010s logo and wack YTTV on it

3 - The atrocious all star weekend
This years all star weekend was abysmal and I hope Adam silver knows it, he keeps trying to do something special and it’s always worse than the standard formula of East vs West with everyone wearing their teams jerseys, I haven’t even seen any clips of the all star game from this year it was that bad. Not to mention the dunk contest needs to be rejuvenated somehow

4 - Corporate redesign of awards
This is minor but a few years ago they redesigned all the end of season awards, they knocked it out the park with the MVP trophy and then just, gave up? The DPOY used to look like a big defensive trophy, now it looks like you won best regional sales manager at your companies awards night. It’s also basically indistinguishable from the 6MOY, MIP and ROY

5 - Nikes Jersey model
This is more about the city jerseys than anything but the Nike jersey model is terrible, to begin every new Nike jersey basically sucked (we seem to be on a correction course now) but especially city jerseys where fans are subjected to a whole year of pushing these jerseys that are ass (especially because they’ve been redesigned every single year so they run out of ideas) all because they need sales up for the jerseys, especially in the playoffs.

6 - The technicals
By god, the technicals. Dudes getting Td up for showing any kind of emotion because silver wants a respectable product, a league built off of guys like Iverson, Jordan, Bird, Shaq who got in their opponents faces, celebrated loudly and now we have ridiculous techs on pretty normal celebrations, it’s like there’s a no taunting rule. AIs step over would’ve had him ejected in this day.

To finish this isn’t a rant that “the NBA was better back in the day” but the vibe of the nba most certainly was, the players, the drama, the legacy building it’s all still here but it’s just starting to look boring, and Adam Silver needs to bring back some of the stuff he took away that has slowly decayed the feel of the league. I’d like to see if others feel the same or if I just have a stick up my ass today.",BJ2435,1748995432.0,2025-06-04 00:03:52,829,0.93,219,NBATalk,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBATalk/comments/1l2rijw/i_absolutely_hate_adam_silvers_direction_for_the/,https://reddit.com/r/NBATalk/comments/1l2rijw/i_absolutely_hate_adam_silvers_direction_for_the/,Nike Dunk,"I absolutely HATE Adam Silvers direction for the identity of the league Off the bat this post has nothing to do with actual basketball so if you’re here for that sorry lol.

1la13k7,Has anyone else tried to use the insoles with the heel Zoom unit from Nike SB shoes like the Dunks or Janoski's as replacements for existing ones?,"I was inspired by seeing people replace the drop in insoles in their Kobe's with ones off Aliexpress with Zoom units. I've been using Game Day Pro's in my PG6's, but I remembered that my Janoski's came with an extra set of insoles. I've only tried them around the house, but they seem slightly narrower and move around. Maybe the ones from the SB Dunks are a little wider?

1lny4g5,Nike x CPFM Dunks “Swarovski Crystals” from Baskick,"Got these in the mail the other day from Baskick. I’d say that these are better than some other batches. Crystal Placement isn’t perfect. One major flaw is how low the crystals are placed on the right inside swoosh. Do y’all know anyone else that might have better batches of these shoes? If I can find a better batch I might give these one to my homeboy or sum. They have other great shoes, just a little more on the pricier side. I share their whatsapp just in case.

I was sitting upstairs at home, and some person was persistently, knocking on the door to the downstairs suite. I am the one that lives in the downstairs suite, but I was upstairs visiting with the person who lives there. I peeked around the house, and this person was taking pictures with a point and shoot camera of the backyard and my power tools as well as the door, and he also had an iPad with him and was texting somebody. He was wearing a black T-shirt with a blue logo or the right side and had a white Nike swoosh logo on the left-hand side. He did not leave a note, nor did he even attempt to knock on the main door of the house at all. I do not know if it was a sales rep or if someone called bylaw to this residence. Has anyone else had a person with similar clothing and a camera and iPad knock on a secondary suite door but not on the main door to the house? I live in Rutland just off of Springfield Road. I’m not sure if there is a campaign going around or if it was someone for a survey. I tried phoning bylaws to see if someone complained, but all I got was their automated system, I also phoned Rutland waterworks to see if it was someone coming to read the meter. I am a little bit concerned as to what this person‘s intentions were as they didn’t try and knock on the main door of the house and they were consistently knocking on the secondary suite door where I reside. I didn’t answer, and he simply walked away. I did not see him go to any other houses on either side.

1l9g50k,The Nike Swoosh Effect: Why This Simple Mark Dominates Our World,"Close your eyes for a moment. Picture a logo. Any logo. Chances are, the first image that flashed in your mind was a simple, elegant curve. The [Nike Swoosh](https://weandthecolor.com/how-the-nike-swoosh-logo-became-a-global-icon/203651). It’s a mark so deeply embedded in our culture that it feels less like corporate branding and more like a fundamental symbol, like a plus sign or an arrow. You don’t even need to see the word ""Nike"" to know exactly what it represents.

https://preview.redd.it/2aol36ol5g6f1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0f16d2332c7b0f99a3b0db613b60644027fff99

But have you ever truly considered why? Why does this specific shape hold so much power over our collective imagination? The journey of the **Nike Swoosh** is a fascinating study in design, psychology, and masterful marketing. It’s the story of how a fluid line, born from a tight deadline, became the silent narrator for countless stories of human triumph. Let's deconstruct the elements that make this logo a masterclass in visual communication.

# The Anatomy of a Perfect Mark

Before we get to its history, let's look at the shape itself. The genius of the **Nike Swoosh** is what it communicates without a single word. Its design is a visual vocabulary of positive ideas.

First, there is the undeniable sense of motion. The shape is not static; it’s a verb. It arcs forward, suggesting speed, agility, and a smooth, efficient trajectory. It’s the ""whoosh"" of an athlete sprinting past you, the blur of a ball flying through the air. Your brain processes this movement instantly. This dynamism makes it the perfect emblem for a sportswear company.

But there’s another, more subtle layer at play. What does the shape also resemble? A checkmark. Think about what a checkmark means to you. It signifies correctness, approval, success, and the completion of a task. This positive affirmation is baked directly into the logo's DNA. Every time you see the **Nike Swoosh**, you get a tiny, subconscious dose of ""yes, you can."" It's a visual pat on the back.

# A Student, a Deadline, and a Reluctant ""Yes""

The creation of this global symbol was surprisingly understated. In 1971, Phil Knight, the co-founder of what was then Blue Ribbon Sports, was preparing to launch a new line of shoes. He needed a logo, and he needed it quickly. He turned to a graphic design student at Portland State University, Carolyn Davidson, whom he had met while teaching.

The brief was simple: create a ""stripe"" that looked fast. Davidson spent over 17 hours sketching, exploring concepts that captured the essence of movement. When she presented her options, none of the executives were immediately sold. Knight, looking at the curved checkmark, famously remarked, ""Well, I don't love it, but maybe it will grow on me.""

With production deadlines pressing, they chose the design. Davidson submitted her invoice for $35. It’s one of the most legendary transactions in business history. It proves that a world-changing idea doesn't need a monumental budget, just the right spark of insight.

# Engineering a Global Mindset with the Nike Swoosh

A logo, no matter how well-designed, is only a symbol. It needs a story and a mission to give it life. This is where Nike’s branding strategy transformed the **Nike Swoosh** from a simple mark into a cultural phenomenon.

For years, the logo was paired with the company name. But in 1988, everything changed with three simple words: ""Just Do It."" This campaign, created by the Wieden+Kennedy agency, was a stroke of pure genius. It wasn't about selling shoes; it was about selling a mindset. It was a direct, empowering command to overcome inertia and self-doubt.

""Just Do It"" gave the silent **Nike Swoosh** a powerful voice. The logo was no longer just about the grace of a finished movement; it was about the gritty decision to start. It became a symbol for that internal battle we all face before we run, before we jump, before we try. The Swoosh became the banner under which you fought that battle.

# Achieving Wordless Recognition

By the mid-1990s, Nike's brand identity was so strong that it made an incredibly bold move. It began removing the word ""NIKE"" from its products and advertising, leaving only the standalone Swoosh. This was the ultimate flex in the branding world. It was a confident declaration that their symbol had transcended the need for a name.

Think about what that means. The company trusted that a simple shape could carry the entire weight of its brand, its history, and its ethos. And it worked. The ""nameless"" **Nike Swoosh** became even more powerful. It felt more personal, more universal. It wasn't just a company's logo anymore; it was our symbol for aspiration and action. It had achieved a level of recognition that few brands in history ever will.

# Why the Swoosh Endures and Thrives

So why does the **Nike Swoosh** continue to feel so relevant today? Its endurance comes from a perfect balance of consistency and evolution.

Nike has fiercely protected the logo's core identity. It is always associated with top-tier athletes and moments of peak performance. The Swoosh was on Michael Jordan's shoes as he defied gravity, and on Serena Williams' visor as she dominated the court. The logo absorbs the excellence of those who wear it, continuously recharging its meaning.

At the same time, Nike allows the Swoosh to be a canvas for culture. High-profile collaborations with designers like Virgil Abloh or brands like Tiffany & Co. have seen the logo reinterpreted in countless ways. It can be deconstructed, stitched, or reimagined in new materials, yet its core shape remains instantly recognizable. This adaptability keeps it fresh and exciting for each new generation.

In the end, the **Nike Swoosh** is more than just a logo. It is a compact, visual poem about human potential. It’s a testament to the power of simplicity and the magic that happens when a great design is fused with an even greater story.

1lao8ig,"Struggled with Nike Alphafly during my 5K race, need advice on shoes for my 10K run","Hey everyone,

I recently ran a 5K race using the **Nike Alphafly**, and unfortunately, the support just wasn’t there for me. I struggled with stability during the race, and I didn’t feel as comfortable as I had hoped. For daily training, I’ve been using the **ON Cloudmonster 1**, and I absolutely love it for its cushioning and comfort.

Now, I’ve got a 10K race coming up, and I typically run at a pace of **7 minutes per** km (about **11:15 per mile**). I’m wondering if any of you could share your experiences with ON shoes for a longer race. I’m torn between the Cloudmonster 2 and Cloudmonster Hyper, which would be better for this distance and pace?

Also, I’ve had a really good experience with the Nike React Infinity, which felt great for both training and long runs.

1lbb61k,Asics Superblast 2 or Asics Novablast 5 In 2 Shoe Rotation With Nike Zoomfly 6 For Speed Intervals?,"Hi am currently using Zoomfly 6 for both speed intervals and easy run days (5 km at a pace of 6 min/ km) and am thinking of adding another pair of shoes as an easy or daily trainer.

I initially decided on the Asics Novablast 5 as I liked the bounce of the FF Blast Max foam. They just released some new colorways for the Asics Superblast 2 here and they look better with more premium uppers, albeit at twice the price. I tried the SB 2 on and it felt more stable but with a fuller stack height. There is a bit more of a rocker at the heel. It was also less bouncy in the forefoot / midfoot than the NB 5 which felt a bit squishy. It gave me the impression of being in between the NB 5 and the ZF 6. 

Which would be more appropriate in a rotation with the ZF 6? My other choice was the Adizero SL Evo (which is priced in between the NB 5 and the SB 2 where I am) but it seems that is more for speed.

1l5fip2,I'm disappointed in footwear quality. The quality of $100 sneakers now match quality of $15 shoes from noname brands,"I'm new to this sub, I hope it's appropriate place to discuss it.

TLDR: Adidas/Puma/Nike/etc now makes the same 3-month-use shoes as noname manufacturers sell for $15. What are the other brands that don't suck?

Long post.

My perspective on these things. I'm located in Ukraine. And as you know from memes, we have certain ""adidas culture"" which is partially true. Second\_to\_cheapest shoes, yes, but our market is different: brands made advantage of that and the same Nikes that cost 40 euro in EU will cost over 100 euro in our official Nike stores because fck you that's why. Most other brands don't practice price gouging and mainly the price difference only appears due to reseller store markup or import taxes. Mainly clothes brands do that.

I remember many years ago shoes were lasting for years, not months. Now even when I don't kick football on my way from school, don't climb trees for apples, don't fight with other kids, somehow my shoes degrade faster when I'm just walking in them. Material quality is so inconsistent that last year I bought new winter shoes (Timberland-style leather boots) and somehow in 3 months of winter my soles are worn off and having holes. Leather parts are like new, the stitching and gluing is in perfect condition. Just the rubber of the sole is worn out.

Also I have Puma sneakers and they just detached from soles because apparently normal walking is now considered extreme sport. I bought Adidas to replace them. Less than 6 months and they have a hole in sole that eats small rocks. For years I have old Sketchers sneakers that for some reason didn't fall apart and degraded normally: normal fabric wear, normal sole wear, no holes, no tears. They're old and I use them for dirty work but they still hold like 10+ times longer than 2 times more expensive shoes.

This post is getting too long.

**Ok, what are other casual footwear manufacturers that don't sell hot garbage?** Many brands tend to switch to lower quality materials and technologies in order to squeeze more margins and profits and keep the perceived price the same. So you buy their $10 t-shirt 2 times per year instead of 1 time like many years ago. I think there should be some brands that still keep the quality of their product.

1lgohs3,This sub makes me smh my head sometimes,"This is a subreddit about sneakers but why is it that designer sneakers get shunned here? I’m being hyperbolic but at least from my perspective it’s somewhat true.

It just makes less sense to me when I see people giving big ups to people paying resell for mass produced Nikes made by someone most likely being underpaid in a country being taken advantage of by corporate big wigs, than when I see designer shoes get no love usually revolving around how much people paid for them or people talking about how they are boring or look like other cheaper shoes (brands like Margiela, Rick Owens, etc.) when these sneakers are usually handmade sneakers in Italy with Italian leather. 

Is there not nuance to the fact that people will pay more for better made products as well as the style of the shoe? I’ll get to the point but I will say that I do recognize that designer sneakers are all overpriced as well. Obviously the reason I posted this is because personally most of my sneakers are Italian made from designer brands. I own Nike’s too but most of my sneakers are from brands like Golden Goose and Margiela, etc. I have never paid full retail for any of them in fact most of them were close to 50% off, which makes most of those purchases only about a $100 difference from Jordan retail prices. (especially pre-covid sales when online boutiques from overseas would have banger sales on designer)

I just feel like there’s some type of discussion to be had about hate towards more expensive products from less-popular brands within sneaker culture, when there’s plenty love towards expensive resold products here.

I’m being hyperbolic but at least from my perspective it’s somewhat true.

It just makes less sense to me when I see people giving big ups to people paying resell for mass produced Nikes made by someone most likely being underpaid in a country being taken advantage of by corporate big wigs, than when I see designer shoes get no love usually revolving around how much people paid for them or people talking about how they are boring or look like other cheaper shoes (brands like Margiela, Rick Owens, etc.) when these sneakers are usually handmade sneakers in Italy with Italian leather. 

Is there not nuance to the fact that people will pay more for better made products as well as the style of the shoe? I’ll get to the point but I will say that I do recognize that designer sneakers are all overpriced as well. Obviously the reason I posted this is because personally most of my sneakers are Italian made from designer brands. I own Nike’s too but most of my sneakers are from brands like Golden Goose and Margiela, etc. I have never paid full retail for any of them in fact most of them were close to 50% off, which makes most of those purchases only about a $100 difference from Jordan retail prices. (especially pre-covid sales when online boutiques from overseas would have banger sales on designer)

I just feel like there’s some type of discussion to be had about hate towards more expensive products from less-popular brands within sneaker culture, when there’s plenty love towards expensive resold products here.
